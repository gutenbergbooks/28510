<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Nearly a century ago, James Boswell made an expedition
to Corsica, and was entertained with distinction
by Pascal Paoli. Next to conducting
Samuel Johnson to the Hebrides, the exploit of penetrating
to what was then considered a sort of <i>Ultima
Thule</i> in southern Europe, was the greatest event in
the famous biographer's life; and, next to his devotion
to the English sage, was the homage he paid to
the Corsican chief.</p>

<p>Soon after his return from this expedition, in 1767,
Boswell printed his Journal, with a valuable account
of the island; but from that time to the present, no
Englishman has written on Corsica except Mr. Robert
Benson, who published some short &ldquo;Sketches&rdquo; of its
history, scenery, and people in 1825. During the war
of the revolution, Nelson's squadron hung like a
thunder-cloud round the coast, and for some time an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
expeditionary force of British troops held possession
of the island. Our George the Third accepted the
Corsican crown, but his reign was as ephemeral as
that of King Theodore, the aspiring adventurer, who
ended his days in the Fleet Prison.</p>

<p>These occurrences, with any knowledge of the
country and people arising out of them, have passed
from the memory of the present generation; and it
may be affirmed, without exaggeration, that when the
tour forming the subject of the present work was
projected and carried out, Corsica was less known
in England than New Zealand. The general impression
concerning it was tolerably correct. Imagination
painted it as a wild and romantic country,&mdash;romantic
in its scenery and the character of its
inhabitants; a very region of romance and sentiment;
a fine field for the novelist and the dramatist; and
to that class of writers it was abandoned.</p>

<p>Corsica had yet to be faithfully pictured to the
just apprehension of the discerning inquirer.
Naturally therefore the author, whose narratives of
his wanderings in more than one quarter of the globe
had been favourably received, was not indisposed to
commit to the press the result of his observations
during his Corsican rambles. Just then, translations
of an account of a Tour in the island by a German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
traveller, appeared in England, and being written in
an attractive style, the work commanded considerable
attention. It seemed to fill the gap in English literature
on the subject of Corsica; and though the
writer of these pages felt that M. Gregorovius'
pictures of Corsican life were too highly coloured,
he was inclined to leave the field in the hands which
had cultivated it with talent and success. Eventually,
however, being led to think that Corsica was still
open to survey from an English point of view, and
that it possessed sufficient legitimate attractions to
sustain the interest of such a work as he had designed,
the author was induced to undertake it.</p>

<p>If the field of literature connected with Corsica was
found barren when examined in prospect of this expedition,
that of Sardinia presented an <i>embarras de
richesses</i>. The works of La Marmora, Captain, now
Admiral, Smyth, and Mr. Warre Tyndale, had seemingly
exhausted the subject, with a success the mere
Rambler can make no pretensions to rival; but the
former being a foreign work, and the two latter out of
print, neither of them is easily accessible. They
have been sometimes used, in the following pages, to
throw light on subjects which came under the author's
own observation. He has also consulted a valuable
work, recently published at Naples, by F. Antonio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Bresciani, of the Society of Jesus<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, on the manners
and habits of the Sardes compared with those of the
oldest Oriental nations. The comparisons are chiefly
gathered from scenes and usages depicted in the narratives
of Homer and the Bible, still singularly reflected
in the habits and traditions of the primitive
and insular people of Sardinia.</p>

<p>Some of these are noticed in the present volume,
and the author intended to draw more largely on the
rich stores accumulated by the researches of the
learned Jesuit; but time and space failed. Like
truant boys, the Ramblers had loitered on their early
path, idly amusing themselves with very trifles, or
stopping to gather the wild flowers that fell in their
way, till the harvest-field was reached too late to be
carefully gleaned. For a work, however, of this description,
attention enough has perhaps been paid to
the subject of Sarde antiquities; it being intended to
be amusing as well as instructive, to convey information
on the character of the people on whom it treats,
as well as on their institutions and monuments.</p>

<p>If, in conclusion, it be mentioned that the delay
in bringing out the volume, long since announced,
has been caused by ill health and other painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
circumstances, the Author is only anxious that it
should not be misinterpreted, as attaching to the
work an importance to which it does not pretend.
But there is the less reason for regretting this delay,
as it has afforded him another opportunity of visiting
Sardinia, as well as of witnessing the operation of
laying down the submarine electric telegraph cable
between Cagliari and the African coast; an event in
Sardinian history, some notice of which, with the
accompanying trip to Algeria, may form a not uninteresting
episode to the Rambles in that island.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Inducements to the Expedition.&mdash;Early impressions concerning
Corsica.&mdash;Plan of the Tour.&mdash;Routes to Marseilles.&mdash;Meeting
there.</i></p>


<p>It would be difficult to say, and it matters little, what
principally led to the selection of two islands in the Mediterranean,
not generally supposed to possess any particular
attractions for the tourist, as the object for an autumn's
expedition with the companion of former rambles. At any
rate, we should break fresh ground; and I imagine the
hope of shooting <i>moufflons</i> was no small inducement to
my friend, who had succeeded in the wild sport of hunting
reindeer on the high Fjelds of Norway. If, too, his comrade
should fail in climbing to the vast solitudes in which the
bounding <i>moufflon</i> harbours, there were boar hunts in the
prospect for him; not such courtly pageants as one sees
in the pictures of Velasquez, but more stirring, and in
nobler covers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Should these prove to be false hopes, the enthusiastic
sketcher, and the lover of the grand and beautiful in nature,
must find ample compensation in the scenery of mountains
lifting their snowy peaks from bases washed by the sunny
Mediterranean,&mdash;mountain systems of a character yet unvisited,
and with which we could at least compare those of
Norway and Switzerland. This power of comparison is
what imparts the most lively interest to travelling; and
thus it becomes, for the time, all-engrossing, the eyes and
the memory alike employed at every turn on contrasts of
form, colour, and clothing.</p>

<p>Not less attractive, to any one desirous of extending his
knowledge of human kind, would be the prospect of studying
the races inhabiting islands as yet unknown to him.
The oldest writer of travels, bringing on the stage his
hero-wanderer along the shores of the Mediterranean,
gives the finishing touch to his character in two significant
words, &#957;&#8057;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#947;&#957;&#8182;.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Not only did he &ldquo;visit the abodes of
many people,&rdquo; but he &ldquo;studied their &#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962;;&rdquo; all that the
term involves of its impress on character, habits, and institutions
was keenly investigated by the accomplished navigator.
And what studies must be afforded by these singular
islanders, who, we were informed, in the centre of the
Mediterranean, at the very threshold of civilisation, combined
many of the virtues, with more than the ferocity,
of barbarous tribes!</p>

<p>My own impressions regarding Corsica were early received.
In my younger days, there was the same sort of
sympathy with the Corsicans which we now find more
noisily, and sometimes absurdly, displayed for the Poles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
I had seen Pascal Paoli, and talked with General Dumouriez
about his first campaign against the Corsican mountaineers,
of which his recollections were by no means
agreeable. Pascal Paoli had found an asylum in England,
where he maintained a dignified seclusion, not always
imitated by patriot exiles. His memory has almost passed
away, and it is quite imaginable that some stump orator
may reckon him among the exiled Poles of former days.
Pascal Paoli was, however, a truly great man. In my
boyish enthusiasm&mdash;all &ldquo;Grecians&rdquo; are in the heroics
about patriots who have fought and struggled for their
country's liberty&mdash;I compared him with Aristides or
Themistocles; the Corsicans were heroes; the country
which rudely nursed those brave mountaineers&mdash;I had
also a touch of sentiment for the sublime and beautiful in
nature which a schoolboy does not always get from books,&mdash;such
a country must be romantic. Should I ever
ramble among its mountains, forests, and sunny valleys?</p>

<p>At last, long after the chimera, for such it inevitably
was, of Corsican independence had vanished, my cherished
hopes have been realised,&mdash;with what success will appear
in the following pages. I will only say for myself, and I
believe my fellow-traveller participates the feeling, a more
delightful tour I never made.</p>

<p>Corsica had an ugly reputation for <i>banditisme</i>, and
Sardinia for a deadly <i>intemp&eacute;rie</i>; but we did not attach
much importance to such rumours. The enthusiastic
traveller disregards danger. If told that there is &ldquo;a lion
in his path,&rdquo; he only goes the more resolutely forward.
As for the banditti, we would fraternise with them if
they, best knowing the mountain paths, would track the
moufflons for us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The true traveller must &ldquo;become all things to all men,&rdquo;
if he desires to familiarise himself with the habits and
characters of other races. Without forgetting that he is
an Englishman, he will cast off that self-conceit and cold
exclusiveness which make so many of your countrymen
ridiculous in the eyes of foreigners, and, adapting himself
to the situation, become, if needs be, a bandit in Corsica,
a bonder in Norway, drink sour milk without a wry face
in a Caffre's kraal, take snuff with his wives&mdash;be any
thing except a Turk in Turkey; though even there, when
he comes to talk the language, he will adopt the eastern
custom of taking his pipe, his coffee, and his repose, not
chattering, but sententiously uttering his words between
whiffs of smoke, which, meanwhile, he <i>drinks</i>, as the Turks
well express it.</p>

<p>We envy not the man, the T. G. (travelling gent.) of
society, whose principal aim in travelling is to gratify a
miserable vanity; to be able to boast of crossing or climbing
such a mountain; to have to say, &ldquo;I have been here,
I have been there; I have done Bagdad; I have seen the
Nile,&rdquo; or such and such a place. The true traveller is
unselfish. Though to him it is food, breath, a renewal of
life, a fresh existence, to travel,&mdash;half his pleasure is to
carry home from his wanderings, to an English fireside, a
tale of other lands. That happy English home is ever
present to his mind, and, with all his enthusiasm, he meets
with nothing in his rambles he would exchange for its
blessings.</p>

<p>Being strongly recommended to defer our visit to Sardinia
until the latest possible period of the autumn, the
plan finally laid was to take Corsica in detail from Capo
Corso to Bonifaccio, and then cross the straits, as best we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
might, there being no regular communication. Having
landed in Sardinia, we should continue the tour through
that island as long as circumstances permitted; leaving it
by one of the Sardinian government's steam-boats which
ply between the island and Genoa and so take the route
by Turin, over the Mont-Cenis, to Lyons, Paris, and
Boulogne.</p>

<p>As these islands lie on the same parallel of longitude
(11&deg; 50' E. nearly cutting the centre of both), by the route
thus chalked out, we should make a straight course from
north to south, with no considerable deviations, the islands
being, as every one knows, in the form of parallelograms
of much greater length than breadth.</p>

<p>Marseilles was finally arranged to be our port of embarkation,
and the postponement of the visit to Sardinia
till November leaving time on our hands, we had ample
leisure for the accomplishment of some secondary projects,
which brought us into training for the <i>grand coup</i>. My
friend pushed through the more frequented parts of Switzerland
for Zermatt and the Matterhorn. He was much
struck by the remarkable contrast of that stupendous obelisk
of rock, piercing the clouds, with the vast, but still
sublime, expanse of the high Fjelds of snow we had seen in
Norway; and the remark applies generally to the grand
distinctive features of the two countries. Descending the
valley of Aosta, my friend travelled by Genoa and Nice
through the Maritime Alps to Marseilles, going on to
Avignon with some friends he happened to fall in with on
the way;&mdash;such meetings with those we know, and sometimes
with those we do not know, being among the pleasures
of travelling in the more frequented routes. Agreeable
acquaintances are made or renewed; perhaps a day or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
two is spent in travelling together, with a charm that is
very delightful; and you part with the hope of meeting
again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the author, who had been delving in the
Norman Chronicles till every castle and abbey through the
length and depth of the old Duchy were become familiar
names, feeling a strong desire to revisit scenes thus brought
fresh to his memory, shouldered his knapsack at Dieppe,
and spent a most delightful fortnight in rambling through
that fine province.</p>

<p>Many a pleasant story he could tell of wayside greetings
and fireside hospitalities among the Norman peasantry.
The old soldier of the empire stopped his <i>camarade</i>, as
something in our <i>tenue</i> led him to imagine, asking eager
questions about the coming war and the united service,
both which seemed to be popular; while market and fair,
and the communal school, each in their turn, drew forth
amusing companions for the road. But these episodes, and
more serious talk of Norman abbeys buried in the depths
of forests or girded round by the winding Seine&mdash;rich in
memories of the past, but ruins all&mdash;and of Norman
churches and cathedrals, in all their ancient grandeur, or
well restored, are beside the present purpose.</p>

<p>Hastening southward by <i>diligence</i> and <i>chemin-de-fer</i>,
the first vineyards appeared between Chartres and Orleans,
with an effect much inferior, as it seemed, to that produced
by the orchards of Normandy, loaded as they were with
ruddy fruit; but this may be the prejudice of a native of
the West of England. From Lyons, one of the long narrow
steamboats afforded a most agreeable passage down
the stream of the rapid Rhone to Avignon. The autumn
rains, which sometimes caused a weary march through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the byroads of Normandy, had cooled the air, freshened
vegetation, and made travelling in the south of France
pleasant. While journeying on, every hour and every
league bringing me nearer to the intended meeting, it was
natural to feel some anxiety lest in such great distances
to be traversed, with little or no intermediate communication,
something might go wrong, and our plans, however
well laid, be delayed or frustrated. The last stage of the
journey commenced&mdash;should I be first at the rendezvous,
or was my companion for the future waiting my arrival?</p>

<p class="caption">MARSEILLES FROM THE RAILWAY.</p>
</div>

<p>At last, after spending the warm noon of an unclouded
day amongst the noble ruins of Arles, the train landed me
at the station at Marseilles, and my friend was on the
platform. The pleasure of casual meetings <i>en route</i> has
been just adverted to. How joyous was that of two travellers,
wanderers together in times gone by, who now
met so far from home, after their separate courses, with a
fresh field opening before them!&mdash;the recognition, doubt
and uncertainty vanishing, the glorious chat,&mdash;all this the
warm-hearted reader will easily imagine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

punctual to the appointed day. Our several lines of route
had well converged. Want of companionship was the only
drawback on the pleasure they had afforded; but they
were only preludes to the joint undertaking on which we
now entered. Each recounted his past adventures, and
measures were concerted for the future.</p>

<p>Steamboats leave Marseilles three times every week for
Corsica;&mdash;I like to be particular, especially when one gets
beyond Murray's beat. One of these boats calls at Bastia
on its way to Leghorn; the others make each a voyage
direct to Calvi, or l'Isle de Rousse, and Ajaccio.</p>

<p>It suited us best to land at Bastia, but we were detained
three days at Marseilles waiting for the boat. That also
happened to suit us. We had hitherto travelled in the
lightest possible marching order, and some heavier baggage,
containing equipments for our expedition in the
islands, had not yet turned up. Knapsack tours are not
the style beyond the Alps. In the south and east, all
above the lowest grade ride. It is so in Corsica; still
more in Sardinia,&mdash;where all is eastern. We trudged on
foot sometimes in Corsica, to get into the country, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
should have been considered mad; but, as Englishmen, we
were only eccentric. We waited then for our baggage,
which contained, among other things, English saddles,&mdash;a
great luxury. My companion thought it a professional
duty to reconnoitre the fortifications of Toulon. By travelling
in the night, going and returning, he contrived to
get a clear day for the purpose.</p>

<p>Marseilles had interest enough to occupy my attention
during his absence. Being the great <i>entrep&ocirc;t</i> of commerce,
and centre of communication, in the Mediterranean,
all the races dwelling on its shores, and many others, are
represented there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go to the <i>Grand Caf&eacute;</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;I think it is called
<i>Caf&eacute; de l'Orient</i>&mdash;said my companion, the evening we
met.</p>

<p>Any one who has merely visited Paris may imagine the
brilliance of this vast <i>salon</i>, the lights reflected on a
hundred mirrors. But where else than at Marseilles could
be found such an assemblage as now crowded it?</p>

<p>See that Turk, with the magnificent beard. What yards
of snowy gauze-like cambric, with gold-embroidered ends,
are wound in graceful folds round the fez, contrasting
with the dark mahogany colour of his sun-burnt brow.
And what a rich crimson caftan! Perhaps he is from
Tunis or Barbary. He sits alone, smoking, with eyes
half-closed, grave and taciturn.</p>

<p>They must be Greeks,&mdash;those two figures in dark-flowing
robes. They too wear the red fez. Mark the neat moustache,
the clean chiselled outline of their features, the
active eye. They are eagerly conversing over that round
marble table while they sip their coffee. Their talk must
be of the corn markets. Now is their opportunity, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
harvest in France has failed. And see that man with the
olive complexion, keen features, and ringlets of black hair
and pendent ear-rings under his dark <i>barrette</i>. He may
be the <i>padr&oacute;ne</i> of some felucca from Leghorn or Naples.
Beside him is a Spaniard. He, too, seems a seafaring
man; and no felucca-rigged vessels in the Mediterranean
are smarter, finer-looking craft than the Spanish.</p>

<p>There are plenty of Arabs, swarthy, high-cheeked-boned,
keen-eyed fellows, in snowy bournouses, with hair and
moustache of almost unnatural blackness. French officers
of every arm in the service are grouped round the tables,
drinking <i>eau-sucr&eacute;</i> and playing at dominoes or cards, or
lounge on the sofas reading the gazettes. The <i>gar&ccedil;ons</i>
in scarlet tunics, relieved by their white turbans and
cambric trowsers, are hurrying to and fro at the call of
the motley guests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those two gentlemen just entering are Americans, not
of the Yankee type, with free and easy air, and tall lanky
forms. I made their acquaintance in the steam-boat down
the Rhone. They are men of great intelligence, perfect
<i>savoir-vivre</i>, and calm dignity of manner, patrician citizens
of a republic. One of them wore his plaid as gracefully as
a toga. I set him down for a senator from one of the
Southern states.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen no English here,&rdquo; said my companion.
Next day he met his friend Captain H&mdash;&#8212; returning on
leave from Malta to England. Marseilles is on the highway
to all the East, and on the arrival or departure of the
packets connected with the &ldquo;Overland Route&rdquo; there must
be a strong muster of our countrymen, and women too.</p>

<p>Turning out of the shady avenue of the Corso on a
sultry afternoon, I sauntered down the <i>Rue de la Cannebi&egrave;re</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
towards the port. It was the busiest part of the
day, for there seemed to be no idle time for the <i>siesta</i>
here. The streets and quays were thronged with people of
the same varieties of race we had seen in the <i>caf&eacute;</i>; most of
them, of course, of an inferior class. There can be no
mistaking that wild-looking creature, bare-legged, and in
a white bournouse, who is staring with curious eyes at
the splendid array of jewellery and plate displayed to his
eager gaze in that shop window. Again he pauses before
that elegant assortment of silks and shawls. What tales
of European luxury will the child of the desert carry back
to the tents of the Bedouins!</p>

<p>I found the port crowded with ships of all nations, the
quays encumbered with piles of <i>barriques</i> and mountains
of Egyptian wheat discharged in bulk. What blinding
dust as they shovel it up! What a suffocating heat!
What smells in this hollow trough which receives the filth
of all the town! How curiously names on the sterns of
vessels, and <i>annonces</i> over the shops of <i>traiteurs</i> and ship-chandlers,
in very readable Greek, carry the mind back to
the Phoc&aelig;an founders of this great emporium of commerce!</p>

<p>It was a cooler walk along the <i>Rue de Rome</i>, and by
the <i>March&eacute;-aux-Capucins</i>, gay with fruits and flowers, to
the Museum library, in search of books relating to Corsica.
There was some difficulty in discovering it. Literature
and science do not appear to be much in vogue in this
seat of commerce. The Museum was closed, the <i>custode</i>
absent, but a good-humoured porter allowed me a stranger's
privilege, and took me into the library; giving me also
some details of Corsican roads from his personal knowledge.
The only book I discovered was Vallery's Travels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
I made a few extracts, and found no reason to desire more.
Few foreigners write travels in a style suited to the English
taste. They are at home among cities, and galleries, and
works of art, but have little real feeling for natural
objects, and ill disguise it by pompous phrases, glitter,
and sentiment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us take a boat and sail over to the islands lying
off the harbour,&rdquo; said my fellow-traveller one afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p class="caption">ISLETS OFF MARSEILLES.</p>
</div>

<p>These islets,
most of them
mere rocks, form
a sort of sheltered
strait, or
roadstead, of
which the island
of Rion, with
Cape Morgion
on the mainland
opposite,
are the extreme
points. Pom&egrave;gue and Ratoneau are connected by a
breakwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Gar&ccedil;on</i>, put a roast fowl and some <i>p&acirc;t&eacute;s</i>, with a loaf
of bread and a bottle of Bordeaux, into a <i>corbeille</i> and
send it down to the port.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We bought some grapes as we went along. There are
landing-stairs at the upper end of the harbour, where
pleasure-boats lie. We stepped into one, and were rowed
down in a narrow channel between four or five tiers of
ships, loading and unloading at the quays on each side.
An arm of the Mediterranean, a thousand yards long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
forms a noble harbour; but, foul, black, and stagnant, how
different were its waters from the bright sea without!
After passing the forts defending the narrow entrance, we
hoisted sail. On the right was the new harbour of <i>La
Joliette</i>, connected with the old port by a canal. At present
it did not appear to be much frequented, but, during
the war in the East, both scarcely sufficed for the vast
flotilla employed in conveying troops and stores. It must
be difficult for any one who has not witnessed it to conceive
the scene Marseilles then presented.</p>

<p>We now discussed the contents of our hamper with
great <i>go&ucirc;t</i>, the boatman occasionally pulling an oar as the
wind was scant. But we had sufficiently receded from
the shore to command a view of the basin in which Marseilles
stands, and the amphitheatre of hills surrounding
it, studded with the country-houses of the citizens; small
cottages, called <i>bastides</i>, thousands of which spot the slopes
of the hills like white specks.</p>

<p>High upon a rocky summit stands the chapel of <i>Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde</i>,
held in great reverence, and much
resorted to, by mariners and fishermen; the walls and
roof being hung with votive offerings, commemorating
deliverances from shipwreck and other ills to which
mariner-flesh is heir.</p>

<p>Seaward lay the islands for which we were bound, but
without any immediate prospect of reaching them, as the
wind died away. It was pleasant enough to lie listlessly
floating on the blue Mediterranean, with such charming
views of the coast and the islands, and the picturesque
craft in every direction becalmed like our own skiff: but
we had another object in our evening's excursion; so, lowering
the lateen sail, my companion took one of the oars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and the boatman, reinforced by a strong and steady stroke,
pulling with a will, we soon landed at the foot of the
black and frowning rock, crowned on the summit by the
square massive donjon of the <i>Ch&acirc;teau d'If</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/014.jpg" width="500" height="367" alt="CH&Acirc;TEAU D'IF." title="CH&Acirc;TEAU D'IF." />
<p class="caption">CH&Acirc;TEAU D'IF.</p>
</div>

<p>The whole circuit of the cliffs, containing an area of,
perhaps, two acres, is surrounded by fortifications. Climbing
some rocky steps, we waited in the guardroom till the
<i>conci&egrave;rge</i> brought the keys of the castle. It was formerly
used as a state prison; and the vaulted passages, echoing
to the clang of keys and bolts, and deep and gloomy
dungeons, from which air and light were almost excluded
by the thick walls, reminded one of the unhappy wretches,
victims of despotic or revolutionary tyranny, who had been
immured there without trial and without hope. The
island now serves as a dep&ocirc;t for recruits to fill up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
regiments serving in Algiers; and some of the larger
apartments of the ch&acirc;teau are used as a caserne.</p>

<p>But the <i>Ch&acirc;teau d'If</i> is probably best known to many
of my readers as connected with a remarkable incident
in the adventures of the Count de Monte-Cristo, the
hero of the celebrated novel of Alexandre Dumas. The
story is shortly this:</p>

<p>Dant&egrave;s (the count) being thrown into one of the
dungeons, remains in hopeless captivity for a great number
of years. In the end, by working his way through the
massive walls, he establishes a communication with the
cell of another prisoner, who was in a still more deplorable
condition. His fellow-prisoner dies, and Dant&egrave;s effects
his escape by contriving to insert himself in the sack in
which the corpse of his friend was deposited; having first
dressed the body in his own clothes, and placed it in his
bed, to deceive the gaolers. In the dead of the night the
sack is thrown into the sea from the castle walls, and
Dant&egrave;s sinks with a thirty-two-pound shot fastened to
his feet. He cuts the cord with a knife he had secreted,
and, disengaged from the sack, rises to the surface and
swims to a neighbouring island.</p>

<p>We were looking over the battlements towards these
islands. One of them is covered by a vast lazzeretto,&mdash;a
place, for the time, only a few degrees worse than the
prison. The isles of Ratoneau and Pom&egrave;gue lay nearest.
Farther off was L&eacute;maire, to which Dant&egrave;s is described as
swimming. They are all mere rocky islets washed by the
sea, the group being very picturesque.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon ami</i>,&rdquo; said I, pointing to the isle of L&eacute;maire, &ldquo;do
you think you could do what the count is represented to
have done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! swim from hence to that island? I would
try, if I was shut up in this horrid place, and had the
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The distance I reckoned to be about three miles; and as
my friend has since swum across the Bosphorus, where the
current is strong, he would probably have found no difficulty
in that part of the affair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how about cutting the cord to get rid of the
thirty-two-pound shot, and extricating yourself from the
sack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>&Ccedil;a d&eacute;pend!</i> All this is not impossible for a strong
man in good health; for a prisoner, exhausted by fourteen
years' captivity in a dungeon&mdash;<i>c'est autre chose</i>. Have
you read the book?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much of it; I tried, but could not get on. That
class of works is by no means to my taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;French literature of this school is, I admit, bad for the
weak: it is pastime to the strong, and serves to wile
away an idle hour. This work exhibits great genius, and
a powerful imagination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, indeed, it seems; but may not the <i>vraisemblable</i>
be preserved even in works of fiction? Let us have a
story which, <i>se non &egrave; vero, &egrave; ben trovato</i>. Writers of this
school, my dear fellow, create, or pander to, a vicious taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a play or novel, I grant you, the plot, characters,
and incidents, in order to enlist our sympathies, should be
true to nature and real life. But who looks for this in a
romance? such works are not read for profit, and the
boldest nights of fancy, and some extravagance, are fairly
admissible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Ah, mon cher</i>, my age is double yours, and that
makes a great difference in our views on such subjects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The recruits flocked round us, asking for <i>eau-de-vie</i>.
Many of them were Italians, deserters from the armies in
Lombardy, Piedmont, and the Papal states, glad to change
their service for better pay and treatment under the French
flag, even on the burning plains of Africa. Perhaps some of
them were drafted into that &ldquo;foreign legion&rdquo; which rivalled
the Zouaves in the Crimea,&mdash;<i>&acirc;mes perdus</i>, the most reckless
before the enemy, the most licentious in the camp.
These were merry fellows, launching witty shafts against
Austrians, Pope, and Cardinals,&mdash;<i>maladetti tutti</i>, and
good-humoured gibes at their comrade, who, standing in
an embrasure, bent his back with laudable patience to the
right angle for an easel, while my friend was making
sketches of the rocky islets and lateen-sail vessels reflected
on the mirror-like sea, or of the amphitheatre of mountains
at the foot of which Marseilles stands.</p>

<p class="caption">MARSEILLES FROM THE CH&Acirc;TEAU D'IF.</p>
</div>

<p>Others, leaning over the battlements, whiled away the
listless evening hours, watching fishermen drawing the
seine at the foot of the rocks.</p>

<p>We pulled round to the cove and watched them too; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
very different set of fellows from the <i>malbigatti</i> stationed
above. Fine, athletic, muscular men, their heads bare,
except that a few wore the red cap so common in the
Mediterranean,&mdash;in woollen shirts, with naked feet planted
on the slippery rocks, they were hauling up and coiling
the rope, singing cheerily.</p>

<p>The wind had shifted some points while we were on
the island, and it now freshened to a stiff breeze,&mdash;one
of those sudden squalls for which these seas are remarkable.
The craft, which an hour before lay sleeping on
the waters, had caught the breeze. A brigantine came
dashing up the straits under all sail, her topgallants
still set, though the poles quivered; and smaller craft,
with their long, pointed sails, like sea-fowl with expanded
wings, were crossing in all directions on their
several tacks, making for the harbour or inlets along the
coast.</p>

<p>The sea was already lashed into foam, and tiny waves
broke on the rocks. Loud and hoarse rung the fishermen's
voices as they hauled away to save their nets. It was
time for us to make for the port. A few strokes shoved
the boat from under the lee of the island; the oars were
shipped, and the lateen sail run up by all hands. Hauling
close to the wind, my friend seized the tiller: it was
doubtful if we could make the harbour, which the little
craft, struggling with the breeze, just headed; the towers
of St. Victor being the point of sight in the increasing
haze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Comme les Anglais font des braves marins</i>,&rdquo; said the
<i>padr&oacute;ne</i>, as he stood by the halyards, looking out ahead,
after all was made snug.</p>

<p>We were, indeed, in our element. The sudden squall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
had stirred our blood. Many such rough cruises we had
shared together in old times.</p>

<p>The boat flew through the water, which roared and
broke over the bows. &ldquo;It will be a short run,&rdquo; said the
steersman, &ldquo;if the wind holds on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Port, monsieur, port!</i>&rdquo; cried the <i>padr&oacute;ne</i>, who had
learnt some English nautical phrases.</p>

<p>But it would not do. Approaching the land, the wind
veered and headed us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must make a short tack to gain the harbour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Je l'ai pr&eacute;vu</i>,&rdquo; said the <i>padr&oacute;ne</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About&rdquo; it was. She stayed beautifully, even under
the single sail, and in a trice was lying well upon the other
tack, as we stood out to sea. In five minutes we went
about again, fetching under the stern of a felucca, also
beating into the port; perhaps from Algiers or the Spanish
coast. It was now a dead race with the felucca, which
had forged ahead while we were in stays.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Nous gagnerons, j'en gagerais une bouteille de vin!</i>&rdquo;
cried the <i>padr&oacute;ne</i>, much excited, for he was proud of his
boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Vous l'aurez, toutefois, pour boire &agrave; la sant&eacute; de vos
camarades Anglais.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again we flew through the water, making a straight
course for the harbour. The felucca had much the advantage
of us in breadth of canvas and her high-peaked sails;
but being heavily laden, she was deep in the water. As it
turned out, we did not overhaul her till just before she
lowered her foresail at the <i>consigne</i> office, to wait for
her <i>permis d'entrer</i>, when we shot ahead right into
the port.</p>

<p>We made out the evening at the theatre, well entertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
by a <i>petite com&eacute;die</i>. &ldquo;One is sure to be amused,&rdquo; said my
companion; &ldquo;and it is good practice. It helps to get up
one's French.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Monsieur ne manque que d'&ecirc;tre plus habitu&eacute;</i>,&rdquo; as it is
politely suggested when one is at a loss for a phrase.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Embark for Corsica&mdash;Coast of France and Italy.&mdash;Toulon.&mdash;Hy&egrave;res
Islands, Frejus, &amp;c.&mdash;A Stormy night.&mdash;Crossing
the Tuscan Sea</i>.</p>


<p>Once more we are at the water stairs. A stout boat is
ready to convey us with our baggage to <i>L'Industrie</i>, one
of Messrs. Vallery's fine steam-boats, in turn for Bastia.
Just as we are pushing off, a carriage drives to the quay,
with a niece of General the Count di Rivarola, formerly in
the British service. She is returning to Corsica. We do
the civil, spread plaids, and place her in the stern sheets;
and she is very agreeable.</p>

<p>It is Sunday morning. The bells of the old church of
St. Victor are ringing at early mass. The ships in the
port have hoisted their colours. There is our dear, time-honoured
jack, &ldquo;the flag that has braved,&rdquo; &amp;c., as we say
on all occasions; and the stars and stripes, the crescent
and star, and the towers of Castille; with crosses of all
shapes and colours, in as great variety as the costumes we
saw in the <i>caf&eacute;</i>. The tricolor floated on the forts of St.
Jean and St. Nicholas, as well as on French craft of all
descriptions.</p>

<p>All was gay, but not more joyous than our own buoyant
spirits. Time had been spent pleasantly enough at Marseilles,
but it was a delay; and there is nothing an Englishman
hates more than delays in travelling. Thwarted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
his humour, he becomes quite childish, and frets and
chafes more at having to wait two or three days for a
steamboat than at any other hindrance I know. Now,
when <i>L'Industrie</i>, with her ensign at the peak, had, somehow
or other, with a din of unutterable cries in maritime
French, been extricated from the dense tiers of vessels
along the quay, and hauling out of the harbour, we were
at last fairly on the high road to Corsica, never did the
sun appear to shine more brightly; the Mediterranean
looked more blue than any blue one had seen before, there
was a ripple from the fresh breeze, the waves sparkled, and
seemed positively to laugh and partake of our joy.</p>

<p>We hardly cared to speculate on our fellow-passengers,
as one is apt to do when there is nothing else to engross
the thoughts; and yet there were some among them we
should wish to sketch. Besides French officers joining
their regiments in the island, there was one, a Corsican,
who had served in Algeria, returning home on sick leave.
It was to be feared that it had come too late, for the poor
invalid was so feeble, worn, and emaciated that it seemed
his native country could offer him nothing but a grave.
There was a Corsican priest on board, a pleasant, well-informed
man, who met our advances to an acquaintance
with great readiness, and was delighted with our proposed
visit to his island. Some Corsican gentlemen, a lady or
two, and commercial men <i>en route</i> for Leghorn, completed
the party. We seemed to be the only English. I was
mistaken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, there is a countryman of ours on board,&rdquo; I
said, pointing to a pair of broad shoulders, disappearing
under the companion-hatch. I caught sight of him just
now; a fine, hale man, rather advanced in years, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
fair complexion, ruddy, and a profusion of grey hair. He
wears a suit of drab; very plain, but well turned out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unmistakeably English, as you say; it may be pleasant.
I wonder we did not make him out before among
these sallow-faced and rather dirty-looking gentry in green
and sky-blue trousers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were soon abreast of the group of rocky islets off
the harbour, passing close under the <i>Ch&acirc;teau d'If</i>. The
sea was smooth, the sky unclouded, but a gentle breeze
deliciously tempered the heat, and vessels of every description&mdash;square-rigged
ships, and coasting feluccas and
xebecs&mdash;on their different courses, gave life to the scene.
Thus pleasantly we ran along the French coast, here much
indented and swelling into rocky hills of considerable
elevation.</p>

title="FRENCH COAST OFF CIOTAT." />
<p class="caption">FRENCH COAST OFF CIOTAT.</p>
</div>

<p>We had an excellent <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i>, for which we were quite
ready, having only taken the usual early cup of coffee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
The genial influence of this meal had the effect of putting
us on the best footing with our fellow-voyagers. Pacing
the deck afterwards with the Corsican priest, we were joined
by the stout Englishman. Observing our disappointment
at hearing we should be probably baulked of shooting in
Corsica, he expressed a hope that we would extend our
excursion to Tuscany, where, he was good enough to say,
he would show us sport. He had been settled there many
years, and was now returning to his family by way of
Leghorn. Under a somewhat homely exterior, which had
puzzled us at first as to his position, we found our new
acquaintance to be a man of refined taste, great simplicity,
as well as urbanity, of manners, and keenly alive to the
beautiful in nature and art. Such a specimen of the
hearty old English gentleman, unchanged&mdash;I was about
to say uncontaminated&mdash;by long residence abroad, it
has been rarely my lot to meet with.</p>

<p>On rounding a projecting headland, we peeped into the
mouth of Toulon harbour, and every eye and glass were
directed to the heights crowned with forts, and the bold
mountain masses towering above them.</p>

<p>Presently, we were threading the channel between the
main land and the Hy&egrave;res Islands. They appeared to us
a paradise of verdure, on which the eye, weary of gazing
at the bare and furrowed mountain-sides bounding this
coast, rested with delight. One imagined orange groves
and myrtle bowers, impervious to the summer's sun and
sheltered by the lofty ridges from the northern blasts&mdash;all
this verdure fringing the edge of a bright and tideless sea.
Elsewhere, except rarely in the hollows, the mountain
ranges extending along this coast exhibit no signs of vegetation;
the whole mass appearing, with the sun full on
them, not only scorched but actually burnt to the colour
of kiln-dried bricks.</p>

<p>All the afternoon we continued running at the steamer's
full speed along the shores of France and Italy. Notwithstanding
their arid and sterile aspect, nothing can be finer
than the mountain ranges which bound this coast, as every
one who has crossed them in travelling from Nice well
knows. Glimpses, too, successively of Frejus, Cannes, and
Nice, more or less distant, as, crossing the Gulf of Genoa,
we gradually increased our distance from the shore, together
with a capital dinner, were pleasant interludes to
the grand spectacle of Alps piled on Alps in endless
succession, and glowing a fiery red, which all the waters
over which we flew&mdash;deep, dark, or azure&mdash;could not
quench.</p>

<p>Towards evening there were evident tokens in the sky,
on the water, and in the vessel's motion, of a change of
weather. We were threatened with a stormy night; and
as we now began to lose the shelter of the land, holding a
course somewhat to the S.E. in order to round the northern
point of Corsica, there was no reason to regret that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
passage across the Tuscan sea would be performed while
we were in our berths.</p>

<p>However, we walked the deck long after the other
passengers had gone below; enjoying the fresh breeze,
though it was no soft zephyr wafting sweet odours from
the Ausonian shore. It is a sublime thing to stand on
the poop of a good ship when she is surging through the
waves at ten knots an hour in utter darkness, whether
impelled by wind or steam; especially when the elements
are in strife. Nothing can give a higher idea of the
power of man to control them. With no horizon, not a
star visible in the vault above, and only the white curl
on the crest of the boiling waves, glimmering in our
wake, on&mdash;on, we rush, the ship dipping and rising over
the long swells, and dashing floods of water and clouds of
spray from her bows.</p>

<p>But whither are we driving through these dark waters,
and this impenetrable, and seemingly boundless, gloom?
The eye rests on the light in the binnacle. We stoop to
examine the compass; the card marks S.S.E. Imagination
expands the dark horizon. It is not boundless: the island
mountain-tops loom in the distance. They beckon us on;
we realise them now; at dawn the grey peaks of Cape
Corso will be unveiled; we shall dream of them to-night.</p>

<p>One of the watch struck the hour on the bell. &ldquo;It is
ten o'clock; let us turn in.&rdquo; There is an inviting glimmer
through the cabin skylights. We are better off in this
floating hotel than has often been our lot, baffling with
storm and tempest, benighted, weary, cold and wet, in
rough roads, forest or desert waste, with dubious hopes
of shelter and comfort at the end of our march.</p>

<p>We paused for a moment, leaning over the brass rail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
which protected the quarter deck. Below, on the main
deck, a number of French soldiers, wrapped in their grey
coats, were huddled together, cowering under the bulwarks,
or wherever they could find shelter from the bitter night
wind.</p>

<p>The cabin lamps shed a cheerful light, reflected by the
highly-polished furniture and fittings. All the passengers
were in their berths. We had chosen ours near the door
for fresher air. My companion climbed to his cot in the
upper tier, above mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wake first, call me at daylight. We shall be
off the coast of Corsica. <i>Felicissima notte!</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Coast of Capo Corso.&mdash;Peculiarity of Scenery.&mdash;Verdure, and
Mountain Villages.&mdash;Il Torre di Seneca.&mdash;Land at Bastia</i>.</p>


<p>The voyage from Marseilles to Bastia is performed, under
favourable circumstances, in eighteen hours; but we had
only just made the extreme northern point of Corsica
when I was hastily roused, at six o'clock, from a blissful
state of unconsciousness of the gale of wind and rough sea
which had retarded our progress during the night.</p>

<p>Hurrying on deck, the first objects which met the eye
were a rocky islet with a lighthouse on a projecting point,
and then it rested on the glorious mountains of Capo
Corso, lifting their grey summits to the clouds, and
stretching away to the southward in endless variety of outline.
We were abreast of the rocky island of Capraja; on
the other hand lay Elba, with its mountain peaks; Pianosa
and Monte-Cristo rose out of the Tuscan sea further on.
Behind these picturesque islands, the distant range of the
Apennines hung like a cloud in the horizon. The sun
rose over them in unclouded glory, no trace being left of
the night-storm, but a fresh breeze, and the heaving and
swelling of the deep waters.</p>

<p>Banging along the eastern coast of Capo Corso, at a short
distance from the shore, with the early light now thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
upon it, the natural features of the country&mdash;groups of
houses, villages, and even single buildings of a marked
character&mdash;were distinctly visible. We were not long in
discovering that Corsican scenery is of a peculiar and
highly interesting character.</p>

<p>The infinite variety existing in all the Creator's works
is remarkably exhibited in the physical aspect of different
countries, though the landscape be formed of the same
materials, whether mountains, forests, wood, water, and
extended plains, or a composition of all or any of these
features on a greater or less scale. The change is sometimes
very abrupt. Thus, the character of Sardinian
scenery is essentially different from the Corsican, notwithstanding
the two islands are only separated by a strait
twenty miles broad. Climate, atmosphere, geological
formation, and vegetable growth, all contribute to this
variety. The impress given to the face of nature by the
hand of man, whether by cultivation, or in the forms,
and, as we shall presently see, the position, of the various
buildings which betoken his presence, give, of course, in
a secondary degree, a difference of character to the
landscape.</p>

<p>Remarks of this kind occurred in a conversation with
our stout English friend and my fellow-traveller, while
they were sketching the coast of Capo Corso from the deck
of the <i>Industrie</i>. Trite as they may appear, it is surprising
how little even many persons who have travelled
are alive to such distinctions. What more natural than
to say, &ldquo;I have seen Alpine scenery in Switzerland; why
should I encounter the difficulties of a northern tour to
witness the same thing on a smaller scale in Norway?
What can the islands in the Tuscan sea have to offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
essentially different from Italian scenery with which I am
already familiar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only a practised eye can make the discrimination, and
it requires some knowledge of physical geography, and the
vegetable kingdom, to be able to analyse causes producing
these diversified effects. Every class of rock, every species
of tree, the various elevations of the surface of the globe,
and the plants which clothe its different regions, have
each their own forms and characteristics; and, of course, a
landscape, being an aggregate of these several parts, ought
to reflect the varieties of the materials composing it. An
artist must have carefully studied from nature to have
acquired a nice perception of these varied effects, and even
should he be able to grasp the result, he may not succeed
in transferring it to his sketch. Far less can words convey
an adequate idea of the varied effects of natural scenery;
so that one does not wonder when the reader complains of
the sameness of the representation.</p>

<p>In the present instance, were there pictured to his imagination
the distant peaks of Elba on the one hand, and
on the other the long mountain ranges of Capo Corso,
bathed in purple light, as the sun rose in the eastern horizon,
the grey cliffs of rocks and promontories bordering the
coast, contrasted with the verdure of the valleys and lower
elevations, vineyards and olive grounds on the hill-sides,
and the landscape dotted with villages, churches, and
ancient towers, we should doubtless have a very charming
sketch, but it would not convey a distinct idea of the
peculiarities of Corsican scenery.</p>

<p>What struck us most, independently of the general
effect, was the extraordinary verdure and exuberance of
the vegetation which overspread the surface of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
far up the mountain sides, not only as contrasted with the
sterile aspect of the coasts of the continent we had just
left, but as being, in itself, different from anything which
had before fallen under our observation in other countries,
whether forest, underwood, or grassy slope. For the moment,
we were unable to conjecture of what it consisted;
but we had not long set foot on shore before we were at no
loss to account for our admiration of this singular feature
in Corsican, and in this particular, also, of Sardinian
scenery.</p>

<p>Not to dwell now on the peculiar character of the
mountain ranges of Corsica, I will only mention one other
peculiarity in the landscape which strikes the eye throughout
the island, but is nowhere more remarkable than in
the views presented as we ranged along the coast of Capo
Corso. As the former instance belongs to the department
of physical geography, this comes under the class of effects
produced by the works of man. The peculiarity consists
in the villages being all placed at high elevations. They
are seen perched far up the mountain sides, straggling
along the scarp of a narrow terrace, or crowded together
on the platform of some projecting spur; churches, convents,
towers, and hamlets crowning the peaked summits of
lower eminences almost equally inaccessible. The only
extensive plains in the island are so insalubrious as to be
almost uninhabitable, and this has been their character
from the time the island was first colonised. For this
reason, probably, in some measure, but more especially for
defence, in the hostilities to which the island has been
exposed from foreign invaders during many ages, as well
as by internal feuds hardly yet extinct, nearly the whole
population is collected in the elevated villages or <i>paese</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
forming this singular and picturesque feature in Corsican
scenery. They are visible from a great distance, and
sometimes ten or a dozen of them are in sight at one
time.</p>

<p>Capo Corso is not, as might be supposed, a mere cape or
headland, but a narrow peninsula, containing a number of
villages, and washed on both sides by the Tuscan sea; being
about twenty-five miles long, though only from five to ten
miles broad. Nearly the whole area is occupied by a continuation
of the central chain which traverses the island
from north to south. The average height of the range
through Capo Corso, where it is called <i>La Serra</i>, does not
exceed 1500 feet above the level of the sea, but it swells
into lofty peaks; the highest, <i>Monte Stella</i>, between Brando
and Nonza, rising 5180 feet above the shore of the Mediterranean.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

title="ERSA, CAPO CORSO." />
<p class="caption">ERSA, CAPO CORSO.</p>
</div>

<p>From the central chain spurs branch off to the sea on
both coasts, forming narrow valleys at the base and in the
gorges of the mountains, of which the principal on the
eastern side are Lota, Cagnano, and Luri; the last-named
being the most fertile and picturesque, as well as the
largest of these mountain valleys, though only six miles
long and three wide. On the western side lie the valleys
of Olmeta, Olcani, and Ogliastro; Olmeta being the largest.
The valleys are watered by mountain torrents, often diverted
to irrigate the lands under tillage, as well as gardens and
vine and olive plantations. Each <i>paese</i> has its small tract
of more fertile land, marked by a deeper verdure, where
the valleys open out and the streams discharge their
waters into the Mediterranean. At this point, called the
<i>Marino</i>, there is generally a little port, with a hamlet
inhabited by a hardy race of sailors engaged in the traffic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
carried on coastwise between the villages of the interior
and the seaports.</p>

<p>This mountainous district contains a considerable population,
and the inhabitants are distinguished for their
industry and economy. They live in much comfort on the
produce obtained by persevering labour from the small
portions of cultivated soil. Numerous flocks of sheep are
herded on the vast wastes overhanging the valleys. The
olive and vine flourish, and extensive chestnut woods supply
at some seasons the staple diet of the poorer classes.
The slopes of the hills about the villages are converted into
gardens and orchards, in which we find figs, peaches,
apples, pears,&mdash;with oranges and lemons in the more
sheltered spots. The wines are in general sound, and we
found them excellent where special care had been bestowed
on the manufacture.</p>

<p>The Corsicans are generally indolent, but it is said that
there are no less than a hundred families in the mountainous
province of Capo Corso who are considered rich,
some of them wealthy; and all these owe their improved
fortunes to the enterprising spirit of some relative who
left it poor, and after years of toil in Mexico, in Brazil,
or some other part of South America, returned with his
savings to his native village.</p>

<p>One valley after another opened as the steamer ran
down the coast, each with its <i>Marino</i> distinguished by a
fresher verdure, and its cluster of white houses on the
beach. The night mists still filled the hollows, and villages
and hamlets hung like cloud-wreaths on the mountain-sides
and the summits of the hills; the most inaccessible
of which were crowned with ruins of castles and
towers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Tradition asserts that one of these towers was the prison
of Seneca the Philosopher. <i>Il Torre di Seneca</i>, as it is
called, stands on an escarped pinnacle of rock, terminating
one of the loftiest of the detached sugar-loaf hills.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

title="IL TORRE DI SENECA." />
<p class="caption">IL TORRE DI SENECA.</p>
</div>

<p>Seneca spent seven years in exile, having been banished
to Corsica by the emperor Claudius, on suspicion
of an illicit intercourse with the profligate Julia. The
islands in the Tuscan sea were the Tasmania of the
Roman empire, places of transportation for political
offenders, and those who fell under the imperial frown&mdash;which
was the same thing. Some smaller islands off
the Italian coast, Procida, Ischia, &amp;c., served the same
purpose. <i>Relegatio ad insulam</i> was the legal phrase for
this punishment. Augustus banished his grandson Agrippa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to the desolate island of <i>Planosa</i>, the Pianosa mentioned
just before in connection with Elba. There he was
strangled by order of Tiberius.</p>

<p>In some of his Epigrams, and the Books <i>de Consolatione</i>,
composed during his exile, Seneca paints the country and
the climate in the darkest colours. There is no doubt but
these islands, though in sight of the coast of Italy, appeared
to the polished Romans as barbarous and full of
horrors as our penal settlements at the antipodes were
considered long after their first occupation; so that the
picture of Corsica, drawn by Seneca, may have been much
exaggerated by his distempered and splenetic state of mind.
The probability is, that he resided during his exile at one
of the Roman colonies on the eastern coast, Aleria or
Mariana. What is called the <i>Torre di Seneca</i> is the ruin
of a stronghold or watch-tower of the middle ages; and it
is not likely that the spot was occupied by the Romans at
any period of their dominion in Corsica, their possessions
consisting only of the two colonies, and some harbours on
the coast.</p>

<p>But those lonely towers standing close to the shore,
which we see from time to time as we coast along&mdash;massive,
round, and grey with lichens as the rocks at their
base; what do their ruins tell of times past? Were
they a chain of forts for the defence of the coast against
Saracen, or other invaders, in the middle ages? They
appear too small to hold a garrison, and too insulated for
mutual support. More probably they were watch-towers,
from which signals were made when the vessels of the
corsairs hovered on the coast, that the inhabitants might
betake themselves, with their cattle and goods, to the
fortified villages and castles on the hills. We are told that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
at the beginning of the eighteenth century, there were
fifteen of those towers on the north coast of the island,
and eighty-five in its whole circuit; but many of them
are now fallen to ruin.</p>

<p>At length, Bastia appeared in sight, rising in an amphitheatre
to a ridge studded with villas; the houses of the
old town being crowded about the port. Sweeping round the
mole, we found ourselves in a diminutive harbour, among
vessels of small burthen. This basin is surrounded on
three sides by tall gloomy buildings, of the roughest construction,
piled up, tier above tier, to a great height. A
man-of-war's boat shoves off from the shore in good style,
and lands the Count's niece with due honours. Other
boats come alongside the steamer, and all is confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see the meeting between the two Corsican
brothers&mdash;the sallow, fever-worn soldier from Algiers,
our poor fellow-traveller, and the hearty mountaineer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I was paying my last <i>devoirs</i> to <i>madame</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The contrast between the two was striking. I shall
never forget the way they were laced in each other's arms,
and the glance of keen anxiety with which the mountaineer
looked into his sick brother's face, marking the ravages
which time and disease had worked on those much-loved
features.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the air of his mountain-village that brother, we
would hope, grew strong again. Perhaps, having rejoined
his regiment, his bones are left in the Crimea; perhaps, he
again survives, and breathes once more his native air.
Who can tell?</p>

<p>Our hale English friend remained on board to pursue
the voyage to Leghorn. What a din, what frantic gestures,
what a rush of these irascible Corsicans at our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
baggage! It is borne off to the custom-house, and undergoes
an examination far from rigorous. We mount several
flights of steps, leading from one narrow street to another
in this old quarter of the town, and are led to an hotel,
which had much the air of a second or third-rate Italian
<i>locanda</i>&mdash;lofty and spacious apartments, neither clean nor
well arranged; and the <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i> was a sorry affair. <i>N'importe</i>;
we shall not stay longer in Bastia than is necessary,
and we may go further and fare worse. Meanwhile, a
battalion of French infantry were on parade, with the
band playing in the barrack-yard under our windows. We
threw them open to enjoy the fresh breeze and sweeten the
room. They commanded a fine view of the coast we had
passed, now seen in profile under the effect of a bright
sunshine, with the waves washing in wreaths of foam on
every jutting point and rock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Bastia.&mdash;Territorial Divisions.&mdash;Plan of the Rambles.&mdash;Hiring
Mules.&mdash;The Start.</i></p>


<p>I cannot imagine any one's loitering in Bastia longer than
he can help. Its only attractions are the sea and the mountain
views from the environs; and those are commanded
equally well from many points along the coast. What the
old town is we have already seen&mdash;narrow and crooked
streets, with gaunt houses piled up about the port; and
there is the old Genoese fortress frowning over it, and the
church of St. John, of Pisan architecture, the interior rich
in marbles and gilding, but the <i>fa&ccedil;ade</i> below notice as a
work of art. A new quarter has been added to the town,
higher up, in which there are some handsome houses,
particularly in the <i>Rue de la Traverse</i>.</p>

<p>In early times a few poor traders from Cardo, a <i>paese</i>
on the heights, settled at the mouth of a stream which
formed here a small harbour. It was their <i>Marino</i>, so
that Cardo may be said to be in some sort the Fiesole of
Bastia. About the close of the fourteenth century, the
Genoese built the Donjon, which is still standing, to defend
the port, then becoming of importance. From this <i>basti&oacute;ne</i>,
the new town derived its name. It was the capital
of the island during the Pisan and Genoese occupation,
and so continued under the French government till 1811,
when the prefecture and general administration of affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
were transferred to Ajaccio, where also the Council-general
of Corsica, now forming a department of France, holds its
sessions. Bastia, however, is still the <i>Quartier-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>
of the military in the island, and the seat of the <i>Cour de
Cassation</i> and <i>Cour d'Appel</i>, tribunals exercising superior
jurisdiction over all the other courts. It is also the most
populous town in Corsica (14,000 souls being the return of
the last census), and has by far the largest commerce,
exporting olive-oil and wine, fruits and fish; and importing
<i>corn</i>, groceries, tobacco, and manufactured articles of all
kinds.</p>

<p>Bastia was the standing point from which the old division
of Corsica into the <i>di qu&agrave;</i> and the <i>di l&agrave; dei monti</i>&mdash;the
country on this side and the country on the other side of
the mountains&mdash;was made; the line of intersection commencing
at the point of Gargalo, below Aleria, on the
eastern coast, and following a range of mountains westward
to the <i>Marino</i> of Solenzara. The division was by
no means equal; the country <i>di qu&agrave;</i>, including the present
arrondissements of Bastia, Corte, and Calve, being
one-third larger than the <i>di l&agrave;</i>, comprising the arrondissements
of Ajaccio and Sartene.</p>

<p>Another ancient division of Corsica was into <i>pieves</i>, originally
ecclesiastical districts,&mdash;and <i>paeses</i>, which, I imagine,
are equivalent to parishes, including the village and the
hamlets belonging to them. A detached farm-house, such
as are scattered everywhere in England, is hardly to be seen
in Corsica, the inhabitants being gathered in these villages
and hamlets, invariably built, as already observed, on elevated
points. By what corruption these were called <i>paeses</i>,
<i>countries</i>, one does not understand; but it sounds rather
droll to a stranger, when he is told in Corsica, that he may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
travel many miles, <i>senza ved&egrave;re uno pa&eacute;se</i>, without seeing
a country.</p>

<p>Bastia must, doubtless, from the circumstances mentioned,
have good society; but we thought Ajaccio a much
pleasanter place, and Corte, in its rudeness, has a nobler
aspect than either, and is associated with glorious recollections.
We were for escaping the <i>di qu&agrave;</i> of Bastia and the
<i>littorale</i>, and getting as soon as possible <i>di l&agrave;</i> the mountains,
not, however, according to the old political division
of the island, but in the sense of crossing the central chain
by one of the nearest passes.</p>

<p>The plan we sketched, after consulting our maps, was to
cross the Serra by a <i>col</i> leading into the valleys in the
south-west of Capo Corso, and, after rambling through that
district, to descend into the upper valley of the Golo, and
pursue it in the direction of Corte, making Ajaccio our
next point. There are good highroads throughout the
island, with regular <i>diligences</i> all the way from Bastia to
Bonifaccio; but to avail ourselves of these, taking up our
quarters in the towns and making excursions in the neighbourhood,
was not to our taste. We proposed, therefore,
to hire mules for the expedition, sending our heavier
baggage forward to Ajaccio by <i>voiture</i>, and retaining only
the indispensables for a journey of more than 150 miles, in
the course of which not a single decent <i>albergo</i> was to be
met with, except at Corte.</p>

<p>The horses in Corsica are diminutive and of an inferior
breed, mules being almost exclusively employed for draught
on the great roads, and as beasts of burthen in the byways
and mountain tracks. In Sardinia, on the contrary, though
lying so much further south, the mules disappeared, and
were replaced by hardy and active horses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>We inquired for mules. There are generally to be found
hanging about foreign hotels people ready to undertake
anything the traveller may require, little as they may be
competent to fulfil their engagements. One of this class
presented himself, his appearance by no means prepossessing;
but the view he took of our present scheme afforded
us some amusement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you well acquainted with the roads in Corsica?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have had the honour to conduct <i>signore forestiere</i>
throughout the island from Bastia to Bonifaccio.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall not travel <i>en voiture</i>. We require mules for
the baggage and riding. Can you supply them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>&Ccedil;a serait possible, mais, &agrave; l'improviste, un peu difficile</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is indispensable, as we mean to cross the mountains
and make a <i>d&eacute;tour, en route</i> to Corte by slow stages, resting
in the villages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man's countenance assumed a rueful expression.
He had probably been used to make easy work of it from
town to town, and there was evidently a ludicrous struggle
between the temptation of a profitable job and his disinclination
for rugged roads and a spare diet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are <i>messieurs</i> aware that there are no <i>auberges</i> in the
villages offering accommodations fit for them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very possible; that does not occasion us any
uneasiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Les chemins sont affreux.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>N'importe</i>; we have travelled in worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In some places they are dangerous, absolutely precipitous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall walk; <i>en effet</i>, it is possible we may walk
great part of the journey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>That our muleteer could not understand at all: &ldquo;<i>la
fatigue serait p&eacute;nible</i>;&rdquo; and with true Corsican indolence,
he protested against being included in that part of our
plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you can ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So far all objections were dismissed. The banditti had
not been mentioned among the lions in our path, but I
imagined they were darkly shadowed forth in the guide's
picture of horrors; so I put the question to him point
blank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the roads safe in these districts? Are there no
bad people (<i>mauvais gens</i>&mdash;<i>cattive genti</i>) abroad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His only reply was a shrug of the shoulders, the foreign
substitute for a Burleigh shake of the head; leaving us to
infer that we must not make too sure of coming off with
a whole skin. Knowing well enough that all apprehensions
of that kind were imaginary, we had been
only amusing ourselves with him. If there had been
any danger, he seemed just the fellow to be in league
with the brigands.</p>

<p>All topics of intimidation being now exhausted, our
muleteer, with the best grace he could, professed himself
ready to comply with our wishes.</p>

<p>The hire demanded for the mules was five francs per
day each, exclusive of their keep; and their return
journey was to be paid for at the same rate. The latter
part of the demand was an imposition, but we had only
&ldquo;Hobson's choice,&rdquo; and made no difficulties.</p>

<p>When would it be our pleasure to depart? As early in
the afternoon as possible. &ldquo;It would be late;&rdquo; and a last
effort was made to induce us to remain at the hotel till the
next morning, but we were inexorable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Would there be time for us to reach the first village
on the road before dark?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;We might.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Then we
will go. Our baggage will be ready by three o'clock. Be
punctual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We disliked the man, and determined to discharge him
at Corte unless things turned out better than we expected.
As it happened, we were under his convoy for a much
shorter space. We found the Sard <i>cavallante</i>, a much
finer race, trudging on foot through all the roughest part
of the tracks, and perching themselves at the top of a
much heavier load of baggage on the pack-horse, when
they were tired of walking.</p>

<p>It was a strange &ldquo;turn out,&rdquo; that, by unusual exertions,
appeared at the door within an hour of the time appointed.
The mules were no bigger than donkeys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Queste bestie non sono muli; sono dei asini.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was vexatious; but we laughed too much to be seriously
angry; the muleteer, too, deprecating our wrath by
assuring us that his mules had first-rate qualities for
scrambling up and down precipices. So we took it all in
good part, and, more amused than annoyed, assisted in
contriving to adjust the girths of the English saddles to
the poor beasts' wizened sides; and then, declining a
march through Coventry with such a cavalcade, walked
forward, leaving the guide to load the baggage and follow
with the mules.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Leave Bastia.</i>&mdash;<i>The Road.</i>&mdash;<i>View of Elba, Pianosa, and
Monte-Cristo.</i>&mdash;<i>The</i> Littorale.&mdash;<i>An Adventure</i>.&mdash;<i>The
Stagna di Biguglia.</i></p>


<p>The Corsicans are apt to say, that the national roads were
the only benefit Napoleon conferred on his native country.
Like all his great works of construction, they are worthy
of his genius. One of these traverses the whole eastern
coast of the island from Bastia, by Cervione and Porto-Vecchio,
to Bonifaccio. Another line branches off near
Vescovato, about ten miles from Bastia, and following the
valley of the Golo, is carried among the mountains to
Corte, whence it is continued through a wild and mountainous
district to Ajaccio. Similar engineering skill is
displayed in its continuation on the western side of the
mountains to Sartene, and thence to Bonifaccio, where it
also terminates.</p>

<p>On clearing Bastia, we found ourselves on this high
road,&mdash;a magnificent causeway carried nearly in a straight
line for many miles through the plain extending between
the sea and the mountains. Orange groves embowering
sheltered nooks in the environs of the town, and hedges of
the Indian fig (<i>cactus opuntia</i>), betokened the warmth of this
southern shore; and, as we advanced, the rank growth of
vegetation on the flats realised all we had heard of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
teeming richness of the <i>littorale</i>. It was hot walking, and
the causeway and flats would have been monotonous
enough but for the glorious views on either hand.</p>

<p>To the left, the Mediterranean was calmly subsiding
from the effects of the gale, its undulations still sparkling
in the sunbeams. Far within the horizon was the group
of islands which lend a charm to all this coast, and are
associated with great historical names. There rises Elba,
with the sharp outline of its lofty peaks and dark shores,
too narrow for the mighty spirit which ere long burst the
bounds of his Empire Island. Far away in the southern
hemisphere I had visited that other island, where the
chains were riveted too firmly for release, except by the
grave over which I had pondered. Now we stood on the
soil that gave him birth. Why was not this the &ldquo;Island
Empire?&rdquo; The Allied Sovereigns were disposed to be
magnanimous. It was offered to him; why did he refuse
it? Was it that, with far-sighted policy, he considered
Corsica too bright a gem in the crown of France for him
to pluck, without sooner or later giving umbrage to the
Bourbons? May his refusal be cited as a further proof of
the little love he bore for the land of his birth? Or was it
that, when once hurled from the throne of his creation, the
conqueror of kingdoms could not descend to compare one
petty island with another? &ldquo;At Elba he found the horizon,
the sky, the air, the waves of his childhood; and the history
of his island-state, would be to him a constant lesson of
the mutability of human things.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Napoleon emperor in Corsica! On this spot, with Elba
in view, one dwells for a moment on the idea! Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
indeed, Corsica's long-cherished dreams of national independence&mdash;it
was her last chance&mdash;would have been
strangely realised. But her fate was sealed. She had sunk
to the rank of an outlying department of France, and so
remained; with what results we may perhaps discover.</p>

<p>Near Elba, and strongly contrasting with its bold outline,
lies the little island of <i>Pianosa</i>, the ancient Planosa.
Its surface is flat, as the name indicates. That island, too,
has its tale of imperial exile. The young Agrippa, grandson
of Augustus, and heir-presumptive to an empire wider
than that of Napoleon's most ambitious dreams, was
banished to Planosa by his grandfather, at the instance of
Livia. Augustus is said to have visited him there. It
was Agrippa's fate to find a grave, as well as a prison, in
the Mediterranean island; the tyrant Tiberius, with the
jealousy of an eastern monarch, having caused his rival to
be strangled on his own accession to the empire.</p>

<p>Soon after Napoleon's arrival in Elba he sent some
troops to take possession of Pianosa; which, ravaged by
the Genoese in the thirteenth century, had never since
flourished. The fallen emperor himself could not help
laughing at this mighty expedition, for which thirty of
his guards, some Elban militia, and six pieces of artillery
were detailed; exclaiming, as he gave orders to erect
batteries and fire upon any enemies who might present
themselves, &ldquo;Europe will say that I have already made a
conquest.&rdquo; Napoleon partially restored the fortifications
of an old castle, which had been bombarded by an English
squadron, landing the marines, in 1809, during the revolutionary
war. The island now belongs, with Elba, to the
Grand-Duke of Tuscany.</p>

<p>Further to the south appears the rocky island of Monte-Cristo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
This, too, has its tale of exile, insignificant as it
looks except for its sharply serrated outline, and a worldwide
fame. The emperor Diocletian banished here St. Mamilian,
Archbishop of Palermo. A convent was afterwards
founded on the site of the Saint's rude cell. The monks
of Monte-Cristo flourished, as they deserved; the worthy
fathers having founded many hospitals in Tuscany and done
much good. Saracen corsairs carried off the monks; the convent
was laid in ruins; and the lone island remained uninhabited
for a long course of years, except by wild goats.
It was in this state when Alexandre Dumas made it the
scene of his hero's successful adventure after his escape
from the <i>Ch&acirc;teau d'If</i>, and adopted it as the title of his
popular novel. The island having been recently purchased
and colonised by Mr. Watson Taylor, he has built a house
on it for his own residence.</p>

<div class="figright">

title="ISLE OF MONTE-CRISTO." />
<p class="caption">ISLE OF MONTE-CRISTO.</p>
</div>

<p>It is about nine miles in circumference, and I should
judge from its appearance
that the greatest
part of the surface is
rocky, though not without
green hollows, dells,
and verdant slopes. But
the olive and the vine
usually thrive, and are
largely cultivated, on
such spots; and if, as I
should imagine, the natural
vegetation and the
climate are similar to those of the other islands in the
Tuscan sea with which we are acquainted, happy may the
lord of Monte-Cristo be; for, in the hands of a wealthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
English gentleman, such a spot may be made an earthly
paradise.</p>

<p>After about an hour's walk we halted for the muleteer
to come up. A glorious point of view it was, embracing a
wide expanse of the bright sea, with the islands which
had supplied so many striking and pleasant recollections.
Looking backward, the purple mountains of Capo Corso
now appeared massed together in endless variety of outline,
with Bastia at their base, the citadel and white houses
glowing in the evening sunshine. Turning to the right,
the eye caught the fine effect of the meeting of the plain
and mountains&mdash;the interminable level, stretching far away
till it was lost in distance, and teeming with luxuriant
vegetation, but
with only here
and there a solitary
clump of
trees,&mdash;and the
long mountain-range
line after
line rising into
peaks above
the gracefully
rounded hills
that swelled up from the level of the plain. Woods, orchards,
vineyards overspread the lower slopes, the hollows
were buried in thickets of evergreen, and picturesque
villages and towers appeared, though rarely, on the
summits of the hills.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/048.jpg" width="350" height="225" alt="MEETING OF MOUNTAIN AND PLAIN, NEAR BASTIA."
title="MEETING OF MOUNTAIN AND PLAIN, NEAR BASTIA." />
<p class="caption">MEETING OF MOUNTAIN AND PLAIN, NEAR BASTIA.</p>
</div>

<p>Who would not linger at the sight of Furiani, the
most important of these villages, its ivy-mantled towers
crumbling to ruins?&mdash;Furiani, where the Corsicans, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
national assembly, first organised their insurrection against
the Genoese, and elected the prudent and intrepid Giaffori
one of their leaders; with cries of &ldquo;<i>Evviva la libert&agrave;!
evviva il popolo!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Furiani, where, in almost their last
struggle, two hundred Corsicans held the fortifications
long after they were a heap of ruins, and at length cut
their way by night to the shore.</p>

<p>The muleteer at last made his appearance with his sorry
cavalcade, and my companion having taken advantage of
our halt to make the sketch of the &ldquo;Meeting of the mountains
and plain,&rdquo; which was not quite finished, that we
might not lose time, as the sun was descending behind the
mountains, one of the mules was tied to a stake, in order
that my friend might overtake us, while we made the
best of our way forward.</p>

<p>I still preferred walking, and pushed on at a pace which
suited none of my company, human or asinine. We had
got ahead about a mile, when shouts from behind opened a
scene perfectly ludicrous. There was the little mule trotting
up the road at most unusual speed, impelled by my
friend's shouts and the big stones with which he was
pelting the miserable beast. He too came up at a long
trot, rather excited, and calling to the muleteer, &ldquo;Catch
your mule, Giovanni! I'll have nothing more to do with
the brute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it all about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It appeared that my friend, having finished his sketch,
prepared to mount and push after us. The mule, however,
had a design diametrically opposed to this. No sooner was
it loosed from the stake to which it was tied, than the
poor beast very naturally felt a strong impulse to return
to its stable at Bastia. Could instinct have forewarned it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
what it would have to encounter before midnight, the
retrograde impulse would have been still stronger. Every
one knows how difficult it is to deal with a mule when it
is in the mood either not to go at all, or to go the wrong
way. Having driven a team of these animals&mdash;fine Calabrian
mules they were, equal to the best Spanish&mdash;all the
way from Naples to Dieppe, I can boast of some experience
in the mulish temperament.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the English saddle being all too
large for its wizened sides, in spite of all our care in
knotting the girths, it twisted round in the attempt to
mount, and my very excellent friend&mdash;no disparagement
to his noble horsemanship, for one has no firm seat even
when mounted on a vicious pony&mdash;before he could bring the
saddle to a level and gain his equilibrium, was fairly pitched
over the side of the road. Mule having now achieved
that glorious <i>libert&agrave;</i>, the instinctive aspiration of Corsican
existence, whether man, mule, or moufflon, started forward
alone, my friend following, I have no doubt, in rather
a thundering rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At every attempt I made to take the mule by the
head&rdquo;&mdash;such was his account&mdash;&ldquo;he reversed his position,
and launched his heels at me with a viciousness that
rendered the enterprise not a little dangerous, for I do not
know anything so funky as an ass's heels. Had it not
been for saving the saddle, mule might have taken himself
off to Bastia, or a worse place, for any trouble I would
have taken to stop him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may be supposed that this story was not told or
listened to without shouts of laughter, the muleteer being
the only one of the party who was seriously disconcerted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Andiamo, Giovanni</i>,&rdquo; said I, cutting short all discussion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and moved forward. We had lost time, and the
evening was closing in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't you ride, then?&mdash;try the other mule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I thank you; I am not in the least fatigued, and
have no desire to be pitched into a bush of prickly cactus,
or rolled down the bank of the causeway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us push on, then; if we are belated, we may have
worse adventures, this first day of our rambles in Corsica,
before we get to our night's quarters; and where we are
to find them, I am sure I have no idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We walked on at a smart pace, and gradually drew far
ahead of Giovanni and his mules. They were not to be
hurried, and if they had been gifted like Balaam's ass, I
imagine they would have agreed with Giovanni in wishing
<i>l'Inglesi all'Inferno</i>. I don't know, speaking from experience,
which is worst, riding, leading, or driving a malcontent
mule.</p>

<p>The rays of the setting sun were now faintly gleaming
on a vast sheet of shallow stagnant water, the <i>Stagna di
Biguglia</i>, between the road and the sea, from which it is
only separated by a low strip of alluvial soil. It was a
solitary, a melancholy scene. A luxuriant growth of reeds
fringes the margin of the lagoon, and heat and moisture
combine to throw up a rank vegetation on its marshy
banks. The peasants fly from its pestiferous exhalations,
and nothing is heard or seen but the plash of the fish in
the still waters, the sharp cry of the heron and gull,
wheeling and hovering till they dart on their prey, and
some rude fisherman's boat piled with baskets of eels for
the market at Bastia.</p>

<p>This vast sheet of water was formerly open to the sea,
forming a noble harbour, in which floated the galleys of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the powerful republics that in the middle ages disputed
the empire of the Mediterranean and the possession of its
islands. On a hill above stood the town of Biguglia, the
capital of the island under the Pisans and Genoese, till in
the fourteenth century Henri della Rocca, with the insurgent
Corsicans, carried it by assault. The Genoese then
erected the fortress at Bastia, which, with the town growing
up under its protection, became the chief seat of their
power in the island, and Biguglia fell to decay.</p>

<p>Mariana, a Roman colony, stood on the coast near the
lower extremity of this present lagoon; and Aleria, another
still further south, on the sea-line of the great plain
extending for forty miles below Bastia. Our proposed
route led in another direction, and, not to interrupt the
thread of the narrative, a notice of these colonies is reserved
for another opportunity.</p>

<p>We had reached the neighbourhood at which, according
to calculation, we ought to strike off from the high-road
towards the mountains. Now, if ever, a guide was needed;
but Giovanni and his mules had fallen far in the rear. A
by-road turned to the right, apparently in the desired
direction. At the angle of the roads we took counsel,&mdash;should
we venture to take the by-path, or wait till Giovanni
came up?&mdash;which involved a loss of time we could ill
spare at that period of the day. A mistake might be awkward,
but we had carefully studied the bearings of the
country on our maps, and deciding to risk it, struck boldly
into the lane. For a short distance it led between inclosures,
but presently opened, and we found ourselves on
the boundless waste, with only a narrow track for our
guidance through its mazes. We were in the bush, the
<i>Macchia</i> as the natives call it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAP_VII" id="CHAP_VII"></a>CHAP. VII.</h2>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Evergreen Thickets.&mdash;Their remarkable Character.&mdash;A fortunate
Rencontre.&mdash;Moonlight in the Mountains.&mdash;Cross
a high Col.&mdash;Corsican Shepherds.&mdash;The Vendetta.&mdash;Village
Quarters.</i></p>


<p>A slight ascent over a stony bank landed us at once on the
verge of the thickets. It had been browsed by cattle, and
scattered myrtle-bushes, of low growth, were the first objects
that gladdened our eyes. A new botany, a fresh scenery
was before us. The change from the littoral, with its rank
vegetation, close atmosphere, and weary length of interminable
causeway, was so sudden, that it took us by surprise.
Presently we were winding through a dense thicket
of arbutus, tree-heaths, alaternus, daphne, lentiscus, blended
with myrtles, cystus, and other aromatic shrubs, massed
and mingled in endless variety&mdash;the splendid arbutus,
with its white bell-shaped flowers and pendulous bunches
of red and orange berries, most prevailing.</p>

<p>The <i>Macchia</i> is, in fact, a natural shrubbery of exquisite
beauty. We travelled through it, in the two islands, for
many hundred miles, and I feel confident that, to English
taste, it forms the unique feature in Corsican and Sardinian
scenery. This sort of underwood prevails also, I understand,
in Elba, and, more or less, in the other islands of
the central Mediterranean basin. We now fully comprehended
how it was that, when sailing along the coast, our
attention had been so riveted on the rich verdure clothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the hills and mountain-sides of Capo Corso, although at
the time we were unable to satisfy ourselves in what its
striking peculiarity consisted.</p>

<p>The air is so perfumed by the aromatic plants, that there
was no exaggeration in Napoleon's language when conversing,
at St. Helena, of the recollections of his youth,
he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>La Corse avait mille charmes; tout y &eacute;tait meilleur
jusqu'&agrave; l'odeur du sol m&ecirc;me. Elle lui e&ucirc;t suffi pour la
deviner, les yeux ferm&eacute;s. Il ne l'avait retrouv&eacute;e nulle part.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>A trifling occurrence in my own travels gives some faint
idea of the sentiment which dictated this remark. At St.
Helena the flora of the North and South singularly meet.
Patches of gorse (<i>Ulex Europ&aelig;a</i>)&mdash;that idol of Linn&aelig;us
and ornament of our English and Cambrian wastes&mdash;grow
freely on the higher grounds, rivalling the purple heath in
their golden bloom, and shrubs of warmer climates in their
sweet perfume. Returning to England after lonely wanderings
in the southern hemisphere, I well remember how the
sight and the scent of this rude plant, dear in its very
homeliness, recalled former scenes associated with it. I
recollect, too, that the mettlesome barb which bounded
over the downs surrounding Longwood did not partake of
my sympathy for the golden bough I had plucked. The
smooth turf and the yellow furze had no charms for the
exile of St. Helena. Never was the &ldquo;<i>lasciate ogni speranza</i>&rdquo;
more applicable than to his island-prison, and in
his melancholy hours his thoughts naturally reverted, with
a gush of fond tenderness, to the land of his birth, little
as he had shown partiality for it in his hour of prosperity.</p>

<p>On its picturesque scenes we were now entering, with
everything to give them the highest zest. The autumn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
rains had refreshed the arid soil, and the aromatic shrubs
filled the air with their richest perfume. Escaped from
cities, and from steam-boats, redolent of far other odours,
and having turned our backs on marsh, and <i>stagna</i>, and
wearisome causeway, well strung to our work, and gaining
fresh vigour in the evening breeze, we brushed through
the waving thickets with little thought of Giovanni and
his mules, left far behind, and as little concern whither
our path would lead us. It was a beaten track, and must
be our guide to some habitation. A few hours ago we set
foot on shore, and we were already engaged in some sort of
adventure&mdash;and that, too, in Corsica, which has an ugly
reputation! &ldquo;<i>N'importe</i>; it is our usual luck; it will
turn out right.&rdquo; But let us push on, for the sun has long
set, and the twilight is fading.</p>

<p>Fortune favoured us, for the enterprise on which we had
stumbled turned out rather a more serious affair than we
anticipated. It was getting dark, when the footprints of a
mule on the sandy path attracted our notice, the fresh marks
pointing in the direction we were taking. Soon we caught
sight of a small party winding through the tall shrubbery.
The turning of a zigzag on a slight rocky ascent brought
the party full in view, and we closed with it. There were
two girls riding astride on the same mule, with a stout
peasant trudging behind. It was a pleasant rencontre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, friend. How far is it to the next
village?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it called?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Olmeta.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the road good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mountainous and very steep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow us to join your party?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Allons donc</i>; we shall be late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the party moved on. Antoine, our new acquaintance,
was, like most Corsicans, of the middle size, with a
frame well knit. He had a pleasant expression of countenance,
with a frank and independent air, the very reverse
of our muleteer, Giovanni. We amused ourselves at having
given him the slip, and continued to question our new
guide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we be able to procure beds and something to eat
at Olmeta?&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;<i>qualche cosa per mangiare</i>&rdquo; being
always a question of first importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never fear; you will find hospitality?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had no misgivings of any kind. Under Antoine's
guidance we could now proceed boldly, quite at ease to
enjoy all the charms of our wild adventure.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;E pur per selve oscure e calli obliqui,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insieme van, senza sospetto aversi.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ariost.</span> Canto I.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Together through dark woods and winding ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They walk, nor on their hearts suspicion preys.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In about an hour, the moon, then at her full, rose above
the hills on our left, shedding a soft and silvery light on
the mountain-tops; our narrow path through the thickets
being still buried in gloom. Presently a full tide of
lustrous radiance was poured on the waving sea of verdure
and the face of the mountains. We made good speed, for
the family mule, homeward bound, stepped on briskly
under its double burden. Sometimes we kept up with the
party, joining in the talk of the good peasants; at others,
falling behind to enjoy the stillness of the scene, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
abandon ourselves to the contemplation of its ever-varying
features. Now we threaded the bank of a mountain torrent
far beneath in shade, the depth of which the eye was unable
to penetrate as we plunged downwards through the
thickets; then, crossing the stream and scrambling up the
opposite bank, once more emerged from the gloom, and,
standing for a few instants on the summit we had gained,
the grey mountain-tops again showed themselves touched
with the silver light, and the quivering foliage of the
evergreen shrubs, which covered the undulating expanse
beneath, twinkled like diamond sprays.</p>

<p>In these alternations of light and shade, and precipitous
descents which led on to still increasing altitudes, we
followed our rocky path for about two hours, when
Antoine halted his party to prepare for surmounting
the main difficulty of the route, in evident surprise all
the while at finding two Englishmen engaged in an
adventure of which he could not comprehend the motive.
And yet Antoine had seen something of the world beyond
the narrow bounds of his native island. He had been a
<i>matelot</i>, he said,&mdash;made a long voyage, and once touched
at an English port. Antoine seemed to be now leading a
vagabond life. He was not communicative as to why
he left his country or why he returned, and was gay
and melancholy by fits. He did not belong to Olmeta,
but had friends there, to whom he was conducting the
girls.</p>

<p>It is not often that the Corsican women ride while the
men walk, the reverse being generally the case. But
Antoine was gallant, and, on the whole, a good fellow.
The girls, we have said, rode astride; but now, in preparation
for the ascent, one of them slipped off the mule,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
over the crupper, with amusing agility, relieving the poor
beast of half its burden, and they afterwards rode by turns.</p>

<p>We now began the ascent of the pass, the Col di S.<sup>to</sup>
Leonardo, leading into the valley of Olmeta. The Col is
nearly 3000 feet above the level of the sea, and the passage
proved to be almost as difficult as any I recollect having
encountered. We had no idea, when we left Bastia, of
attempting it that evening, and, had we not parted from
Giovanni, should probably have made for some village near
the high-road, and lost the splendid effects of moonlight
on such scenery. The face of the mountain is scaled either
by rocky steps or by terraces cut in the escarped flanks, with
quick returns, in the way such elevations are usually surmounted.
The passing and repassing, as we traversed the
successive stages, brought out the effects of light and shade
even better than we had remarked them below. The path,
too, was extremely picturesque. Masses of grey rock, half
in shade, jutted out among the shrubbery with which the
mountain-side was covered; giant heaths, five or six feet
high, hung feathering, and the arbutus threw its broad
branches, over our heads.</p>

<p>We had made some progress, and stood, as it were, suspended
over the valley, when Antoine's quick ear caught
sounds from below. We halted to take breath and listen.
Presently, the sounds became more distinct, and we made
out the tramp of mules coming up the path, but still far
beneath. It was probably Giovanni with his mules, following
our steps. Again we stood and listened, looking
over the precipice at an angle which commanded the
descent for many hundred feet beneath. The thicket
shrouding the narrow track was so dense, that nothing
could be seen, even in that bright moonlight, but its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
glistening slope. The sounds from below rose more dearly.
Thwack, thwack, fell Giovanni's cudgel on the ribs of his
unfortunate mules; and we could hear them scrambling, and
his hoarse voice uttering strange cries, as he urged them on.</p>

<p>We were too much amused at having given him the
slip to think much of the great tribulation in which he
was panting and toiling to overtake us. Vain hope!
&ldquo;He will be in time for supper; let us push on;&rdquo;&mdash;beginning
to think that the sooner we realised the comforts
which Antoine had encouraged us to expect, the better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we near the top of the pass?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see that rock with the bush hanging from
it?&rdquo; pointing to a huge, insulated mass, its sharp outline
clearly defined against the blue sky; &ldquo;it is a thousand feet
above the spot on which we stand. The path lies round
the base of that rock. In an hour we shall reach it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We climbed on, the ascent becoming steeper and steeper
as we mounted upwards, often casting wistful looks at the
beacon rock. Just before we gained the summit, smoke
was seen curling up from the copse at a little distance
from the path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Ci sono pastori</i>,&rdquo; cried Antoine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they can give us some milk.&rdquo; We had need
enough of some refreshment, the breakfast at Bastia having
been our only meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Ved&eacute;remmo</i>,&rdquo; said Antoine; and he led the way
through the bushes.</p>

<p>Some rough dogs leapt out, fiercely barking at the
approach of strangers. They were called off by the shepherds,
who, wrapped in their shaggy mantles, the Corsican
<i>pelone</i>, were sitting and lying round a fire of blazing logs,
under the shelter of a rock. A mixed flock of sheep and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
goats lay closely packed round the bivouac. Unfortunately
they had no milk to give us.</p>

<p>The Corsican shepherds are a singular race. We found
them leading a nomad life in all parts of the island.
They wander, as the season permits, from the highest
mountain-ranges to the verge of the cultivated lands
and vineyards, where the goats do infinite mischief;
and drive their flocks in the winter to the vast plains
of the littoral, and the warm and sheltered valleys.
Home they have none; the side of a rock, a cave, a
hut of loose stones, lends them temporary shelter. Chestnuts
are their principal food; and their clothing, sheepskins,
or the black wool of their flocks spun and woven
by the women of the valleys into the coarse cloth of
the <i>pelone</i>. Their greatest luxuries are the immense
fires, for which the materials are boundless, or to bask
in the sun, and tell national tales, and sing their simple
<i>canzone</i>. But though a rude, they are not a bad, race;
contented, hospitable, tolerably honest, and, as we found,
often intelligent. We were not fortunate in our first
introduction to these people. Antoine exchanged a few
words with them; but they were sullen, and showed no
signs of surprise or curiosity on the sudden appearance of
strangers at their fireside. The sample was far from prepossessing.
One of the men, who seemed to eye us with
suspicion, had just the physiognomy one should assign to
a bandit.</p>

<p>It was perhaps this idea which led me to question
Antoine on a subject we had hitherto avoided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there any outlaws harboured in these wild mountains?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now; they have been hunted out; all that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
changed; but blood has been often spilt in this <i>maquis</i>.
One terrible <i>vendetta</i> was taken not far from hence; but
that was many years ago. I will show you the spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Antoine strode rapidly onward; and we overtook the
women, who had rode on. In ten minutes we were
rounding the mass of rock crowning the pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was the spot,&rdquo; said Antoine, taking a step
towards me, the rest of the party having passed; and
he added calmly, but with decision, and a slightly triumphant
air, &ldquo;I did it myself.&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>J'ai donn&eacute; le coup
moi-m&ecirc;me.</i>&rdquo;)</p>

<p>It may be well supposed that I stood aghast. We had
not then learnt with what little reserve such deeds of blood
are avowed in Corsica; how thoroughly they are extenuated
by the popular code of morals or honour. Such
avowals were afterwards made to us with far less feeling
than Antoine betrayed; indeed, with the utmost levity.
&ldquo;<i>Je lui ai donn&eacute; un coup</i>,&rdquo; mentioning the individual and
giving the details, was the climax of a story of some sudden
quarrel or long-harboured animosity. It was uttered
with the <i>sang froid</i> with which an Englishman would
say, &ldquo;I knocked the fellow down;&rdquo; and it might have
been our impression that nothing more was meant, but
for the circumstances related, which left no doubt on the
subject. When a Corsican says that he has given his
enemy a <i>coup</i>, the phrase is a decorous ellipse for <i>coup-de-fusil</i>.
Occasionally, perhaps, it may mean a <i>coup-de-poignard</i>,
which amounts to much the same thing; but
since carrying the knife has been rigorously prohibited by
the French Government, stabbing has not been much in
vogue in Corsica. Now, it is to be hoped, the murderous
<i>fusil</i> has equally disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no time for asking what led to the quarrel or
encounter. Antoine coolly turned away, saying, &ldquo;The
descent is easy; we shall have a good road now down the
hill to Olmeta;&rdquo; and, most opportunely, the view which
opened from the summit of the pass was calculated to
divert my thoughts from what had just occurred.</p>

<p>It has been often remarked, that the Corsican villages
are most commonly built on high ground. We now
counted, by their cheerful lights, nine or ten of them
dotting the hills in all directions; some perched on the
heights beyond the Bevinco, which wound through the
valley beneath, the moonlight flashing on patches of the
stream and faintly revealing a dark chain of mountains
beyond&mdash;the Serra di Stella, dividing the valley of the
Bevinco from that of the Golo.</p>

<p>The descent was easy, according to Antoine's augury.
We tear down the hill, pass the village church at a sharp
angle, its white <i>fa&ccedil;ade</i> glistening in the moonbeams; and a
straight avenue, shaded by trees, brings us into a labyrinth
of narrow lanes, overhung by tall, gaunt houses of the
roughest fabric and materials. Antoine bids us stop before
one of these gloomy abodes; an old woman appears at the
door of the first story with a feeble oil-lamp in her hand.
The ground-floor of these houses, as usual in the South,
are all stables or cellars. After a short conference, Antoine
disappears, and we see him no more that night. We
mount a flight of steep, unhewn stone steps, at the risk of
breaking our necks, for there is no rail; the good dame
welcomes us to all that she has, little though it be, and
we land in a grim apartment containing the usual raised
hearth for cooking, with a very limited apparatus of
utensils&mdash;a few shallow kettles of copper and iron, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
table, some chairs, and a very questionable bed in a
corner.</p>

<p>There were two other apartments, <i>en suite</i>, the next
being a <i>salle</i>, with a brick floor like the kitchen, tolerably
clean. A few Scripture prints on the walls, a large table,
some rickety chairs, and a settee, convertible, we found,
into a very satisfactory shakedown, composed the furniture.
The inner apartment, which contained a really good bed,
seemed to be the widow's wardrobe and storeroom of
all her most valuable effects; being crowded with chests,
and tables covered with all sorts of things, helped out by
pegs on the walls. These were ornamented with little
coloured prints of the Virgin, and Saints, and there was a
crucifix at the bed's head. After showing her apartments,
the widow placed the lamp on the table in the <i>salle</i>, with
the usual <i>felice notte</i>, and there was a running fire of
questions and answers between her and the two hungry
travellers about the <i>qualche cosa per mangiare</i>. The larder
was of course empty, and the discussion resolved itself into
some rashers of bacon, a loaf of very sweet bread, and a
bottle of the light and excellent wine for which Capo
Corso is famous, procured from a neighbour.</p>

<p>This was not accomplished without a great deal of bustle
and screeching, and running to and fro of the widow and
some female friends, withered old crones, who had come to
her aid on so unexpected an emergency as our appearance
on the scene. This continued after supper till the chests
in the inner apartment had delivered up their stores of
sheets, coverlets, and towels, all as white as the driven
snow. How we ate, drank, and lodged during our rambles
is not the most agreeable of our recollections, and can
have little interest except as affording glimpses of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
habits of the people. This first essay of Corsican hospitality
was not amiss.</p>

<p>Just as we had finished our frugal meal, Giovanni made
his appearance. Wishing to give him his <i>cong&eacute;</i>, we expected
a sharp altercation; to avoid which, and not forfeit
our engagement that he should conduct us to Corte, it was
proposed to him to leave the malcontent mule till his
return, procuring at Olmeta a more serviceable beast, or
to proceed with the others only. Giovanni was crestfallen;
he had had enough of it, and did not bluster, as we expected.
Though disliking him, we had amused ourselves at his expence,
and could hardly now refrain from laughing at his
piteous aspect. Giovanni, however, was quite as ready to
be quit of us as we were to get rid of him. His reply to
our proposal about the mule was quite touching:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Je ne veux pas me s&eacute;parer de mon pauvre &acirc;ne!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the inseparables were dismissed to return to Bastia,
after an equitable adjustment, and we parted good friends.
Giovanni was no favourite of ours, but that touch of sentiment
for his &ldquo;<i>pauvre &acirc;ne</i>&rdquo; was a redeeming trait. As for
ourselves, we were left without a guide, which did not
matter, and without the means of carrying forward our
baggage, which did. This dilemma did not spoil our rest;
it was such as weary travellers earn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>The</i> Littorale.&mdash;<i>Corsican Agriculture.&mdash;Greek and Roman
Colonies.&mdash;Sketch of Medi&aelig;val and Modern History.&mdash;Memoirs
of King Theodore de Neuhoff</i>.</p>


<p>Let us now return for a short space to the point at
which we quitted the high-road from Bastia. More attractive
metal drew us off to the mountain-paths; but the
<i>Littorale</i> is not without interest, especially as the seat of
the earliest and most thriving colonies in the island.
These and its subsequent fortunes claim a passing notice.</p>

<p>It may be recollected that our road lay for some miles
through the plain between the mountains and the Mediterranean.
This level is between fifty and sixty miles
long. Intersected by the rivers flowing from the central
chain, alluvial marshes are formed at their mouths, and
there are also, from similar causes, several lagoons on the
coast, of which the Stagna di Biguglia, near which we
turned off into the <i>maquis</i>, is the largest. The exhalations
from these marshes and waters render the climate so
pestiferous, that the <i>littorale</i> is almost uninhabited. The
soil is extremely fertile, producing large crops where it is
cultivated, and affording pasturage to immense herds of
cattle, sheep, and goats. The country people inhabit
villages on the neighbouring hills, descending into the
plains at the seasons when their labour is required for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
tilling and sowing the land, and harvesting the crops; and
but too frequently carrying back the seeds of wasting or
fatal diseases.</p>

<p>Even under the double disadvantages of exposure to
malaria, and the natural indolence of the Corsican peasant,
this district supplies a very large proportion of the corn
consumed in the island. So great is this indolence, that
not more than three-tenths of the surface of Corsica is
brought under cultivation, although it is calculated that
double that area is capable of it. I was unable to ascertain
the number of acres under tillage, planted with vines
and olive-trees, or otherwise requiring agricultural labour;
but it might have been supposed that a population of
230,000 souls would at least have met the demand for
labour on the portion of the surface thus occupied. So
far, however, from this being the case, it is a curious fact
that from 2000 to 3000 labourers come into the island
every year from Lucca, Modena, and Parma, to engage in
agricultural employment. They generally arrive about the
middle of April, and take their departure in November.
They are an intelligent, laborious, and frugal class; and as
the savings of each individual are calculated at 100 or 110
francs, no less a sum than 200,000 francs is thus annually
carried to the Continent instead of being earned by native
industry. The climate of Corsica is described by many
ancient writers as insalubrious; but there does not seem
to be any foundation for the statement, except as regards
the <i>littorale</i>, the only part of the island which appears to
have been colonised in early times, and with which they
were acquainted.</p>

<p>Who were its primitive inhabitants and first colonists,
whether Corsus, the supposed leader of a band of immigrants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
who gave his name to the island, was a son of Hercules
or a Trojan, are facts lost in the mist of ages, through
which the origin of few races can be penetrated. An
inquiry into such traditions would be a waste of time, and
is foreign to a work of this kind.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that the light of civilisation
first beamed on its shores from Sardinia&mdash;an island which
some brief records, and, still more, its existing monuments,
lead us to consider as civilised long before the period of
authentic history.</p>

<p>The island of Sardinia, placed in the great highway from
the East, was a convenient station for the people who, in
the first ages, were driven thence by a providential impulse
towards the shores of the West, and, with the torch of
civilisation in their hands, passed successively by Asia
Minor and the islands of Crete, Sicily, and Sardinia to
Greece, to Italy, and the other countries of the West.</p>

<p>A smaller branch of the torrent of this great and primitive
emigration poured from the mountain ranges in the
north of Sardinia, and, crossing the straits, overspread the
south of Corsica, bearing with it the civilisation of the
East, of which records are found in the most ancient Corsican
monuments. Some of these are identical with
those in Sardinia, which will be mentioned hereafter.
Such are the Dolmen, called in Corsica <i>Stazzone</i>; and the
Menhir, to which they give the fanciful name of <i>Stantare</i>.
When a child at play stands on its head with its heels self-balanced
in the air, making itself a pyramid instead of
cutting a pirouette, that is, in the language of mothers
and nurses, <i>far la Stantare</i>.</p>

<p>However this may be, there are numerous testimonies
that the island of Corsica was known and visited in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
most remote times by navigators of the several races on
the shores of the Mediterranean&mdash;Ph&#339;nicians, Pelasgians,
Tyrrhenians, Ligurians, and Iberians. Herodotus,
who calls the island Cyrnos, describes an attempt at colonisation
by Phoc&aelig;ans, driven from Ionia, who founded the
city of Alalia, afterwards called Aleria, 448 years before
the Christian era. But the genuine history of Corsica
commences with the period when the Roman republic, on
the decay of the Carthaginian power, began to extend its
conquests in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In the year 260 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, Lucius Cornelius Scipio led an
expedition into the island, which was crowned with
success. Every traveller who has visited Rome must
have been interested in one of the few relics of the republican
era, remarkable for its primitive simplicity&mdash;the
tomb of the Scipios. It chanced that the writer,
when there, procured a model of the sarcophagus which
contained the ashes of this first of a race of heroes, L. C.
Scipio. The monuments of Rome were not of marble in
the times of the republic, and this sarcophagus being cut
out of a block of the volcanic <i>peperino</i>, so common in the
Campagna, the author had his model made of the same
material, with the inscription cut in rude characters round
the margin; that is to say, such part of it as had been
preserved, so that it is a perfect fac-simile. He reads
on it&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
HEC CEPIT CORSICA ALERIAQUE URBE.
</p>

<p>That fragment contains the earliest record of Roman conquest
in Corsica. But the conquest was incomplete, and
for upwards of a century the Corsicans maintained an
unequal struggle against the Roman legions, strong in their
mountain fastnesses, while the Roman armies appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
have seldom advanced beyond the plains. The natives
held their ground with such obstinacy that, on one occasion,
after a bloody battle, a consular army, under Caius
Papirius, was so nearly defeated, when rashly entangled in
the gorges of the mountains, that the Corsicans obtained
honourable terms of peace. The Roman historians relate
that this battle was fought on &ldquo;The Field of Myrtles,&rdquo; a
name appropriate to a Corsican <i>macchia</i>; and they do not
otherwise describe the locality.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is easy to imagine the
scenes and the issue of a deadly struggle between the
mountaineers and the disciplined legions, on ground such
as that described in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>In these wars great numbers of the natives were carried
off as slaves to Rome, and the annual tribute paid on submission
consisted of wax, which was raised to 200,000 lbs.
after one defeat.</p>

<p>A two hours' walk over the plains from the point at
which we quitted the high-road would bring us to the ruins
of Mariana, a colony founded by Marius on the banks of
the Golo, and to which he gave his name. Not a vestige
of Roman architecture can now be found on the spot.</p>

<p>During the civil wars, the rivals, Marius and Sylla, established
each a colony in Corsica. That of Sylla (Aleria)
stood forty miles further down the coast, at the mouth of
the Tavignano, the seat of the ancient Greek colony of
Alalia. Sylla restored it, sending over some of his veteran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
soldiers, among whom he distributed the conquered lands,
and it became the capital of the island during the Roman
period, and so continued during the earlier part of the
middle ages. Sacked and laid in ruins by the Arabs, some
iron rings on the Stagna di Diana, the ancient port, large
blocks of stone on the site of a mole at the mouth of the
Tavignano, some arches, a few steps of a circus, with coins
and cameos occasionally turned up, are the sole vestiges of
the Roman colonisation in Corsica. Their only road led
from Mariana by Aleria to Pal&aelig;, a station near the modern
Bonifaccio, from whence there was a <i>trajectus</i> to Portus
Tibulus (Longo Sardo), in Sardinia; and the road was
continued through that island to its southern extremity,
near Cagliari.</p>

<p>In the decline of the Roman power, Corsica shared the
fate of the other territories in the Mediterranean attached
to the eastern empire. Seized by the Vandals under Genseric,
despotically governed by the Byzantine emperors,
pillaged by Saracen corsairs, protected by Charlemagne,
and, on the fall of his empire, parcelled out, like the rest
of Europe, among a host of feudal barons, mostly of
foreign extraction&mdash;who, from their rock-girt towers, waged
perpetual hostilities with each other, and tyrannised over
the enthralled natives&mdash;claimed by the Popes in virtue of
Pepin's donation, and granted by them to the Pisans,&mdash;after
a long struggle between the two rival republics contending
for the supremacy of the Mediterranean, the island at last
fell under the dominion of the Genoese.</p>

<p>This dominion the republic of Genoa exercised for
more than four centuries (from the thirteenth to the eighteenth)
in an almost uninterrupted course of gross misrule.
Instead of endeavouring to amalgamate the islanders with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
her own citizens, she treated them as a degraded cast,
worthy only of slavery. A governor, frequently chosen
by the republic from amongst men of desperate circumstances,
had the absolute sovereignty of the island: by
his mere sentence, on secret information, without trial, a
person might be condemned to death or to the galleys. The
venality of the Genoese tribunals was so notorious, that the
murderer felt sure to escape if he could pay the judge for
his liberation.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The Corsicans were not a race which would tamely submit
to this tyranny, and their annals during this long period
exhibit a series of bloody struggles against the Genoese
republic, and devoted efforts to maintain their rights and
recover their independence. In these contests the <i>signori</i>
either allied themselves with the Genoese, or took part
with their countrymen, as their interest inclined; while a
succession of patriot leaders, such as few countries of
greater pretensions can boast&mdash;Sambucchio, Sampiero,
the Gaffori, the Paoli&mdash;all sprung from the ranks of the
people; the bravest in the field and the wisest in council,
carried aloft the banner of Corsican <i>libert&agrave;</i>.</p>

<p>The hostilities were not confined to the parties immediately
interested in the quarrel. Foreign aid was invoked
on the one side and on the other, and for a long period the
little island of Corsica became the battle-field of the great
European powers; Spaniards, Austrians, French, and
English, at one time or the other, and especially in the
decay of the Genoese republic, throwing their forces into
the scale, and occupying portions of the island, but with
no definitive result, until its final absorption in the dominion
of its present masters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Little interest would now attach to the details of a
struggle confined to so insignificant a territory, and having
so little influence on European politics; and it would be alike
foreign to the province of a traveller, and wearisome to the
reader, that the subject should be pursued, except incidentally,
where events or persons connected with the localities
he visits call forth some passing remarks. An exception
may perhaps be allowed in the course of this narrative
for some account of the English intervention in Corsican
affairs. It is little known that our George III. was once
the constitutional king of Corsica. Nelson, too, performed
there one of his most dashing exploits.</p>

<p>Just now we have been talking of Aleria, a place identified
with a curious and somewhat romantic episode in
Corsican history. Corsica cradled and sent forth a soldier
of fortune, to become in his aspirations, and almost in
effect, the C&aelig;sar of the western empire. Corsica received
into her bosom a German adventurer, who, for a brief
space, played on this narrow stage the part of her crowned
king. That there is but a short interval between the
sublime and the ridiculous, was exemplified in the career of
these upstart monarchs. Both sought an asylum in England.
The one pined in an island-prison, the other in a
London gaol.</p>


<p class="title">THEODORE DE NEUHOFF, KING OF CORSICA.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>On the 25th March, 1736, a small merchant-ship, carrying
the English ensign, anchored off Aleria. There landed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
from it a personage of noble appearance, with a suite of sixteen
persons, who was received with the deference due to a
monarch. He superintended the disembarkation of cannon
and military stores, and gratuitously distributed powder,
muskets, and other accoutrements, to the Corsicans who
crowded to the shore.</p>

<p>The imagination exercises a powerful sway over the
people of the South. The mystery which surrounded this
personage, his dignified and polished manners, the important
succour he brought, and even the fantastical and semi-Oriental
cast of his dress, all contributed to produce a great
influence on ardent minds naturally inclined to the marvellous.
This was Theodore de Neuhoff.</p>

<p>Theodore Antoine, Baron de Neuhoff, a native of Westphalia,
had been in his youth page to the Duchess of
Orleans, and afterwards served in Spain. Returning to
France, he attached himself to the speculations of Law,
and partook the vicissitudes of splendour and misery which
were the fortunes of his patron. When that bubble burst,
our adventurer wandered through Europe, seeking his fortune
with a perseverance, combined with incontestable
talent, which, sooner or later, must seize some opportunity
of accomplishing his schemes.</p>

<p>At Genoa he fell in with Giaffori and some other Corsican
patriots, then exiled; and representing himself to be
possessed of immense resources, and even to have it in his
power to secure the support of powerful courts, offered to
drive the Genoese out of the island, on condition of his
being recognised as King of Corsica. The patriot chiefs,
seduced by these magnificent promises, and, perhaps, too
apt to seek for foreign aid wherever it could be found,
accepted Theodore's offers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Not to follow him through all the course of his romantic
adventures, it appears that he found means of credit&mdash;perhaps
from the Jews, with whom he was already deeply
involved&mdash;for a considerable sum of ready money, and the
arms, ammunition, and stores necessary for his expedition.
Landing in Corsica, in the manner already described, the
Corsican chiefs, although they had concerted his descent
on the island, had the address to cherish the popular idea
that Theodore's arrival was a mark of the interest taken
by Heaven in the liberty of the Corsicans.</p>

<p>In a popular assembly held at the Convent of Alesani, a
Constitution was resolved on, by which the kingdom of
Corsica was settled hereditarily in the family of the Baron
de Neuhoff; taxation was reserved to the Diet, and it was
provided that all offices should be filled by natives of the
island. The baron, having sworn on the Gospels to
adhere to the Constitution, was crowned with a chaplet of
laurel and oak in the presence of immense crowds, who
flocked to the ceremony from all quarters, amid shouts of
&ldquo;<i>Evviva Teodoro, re di Corsica!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Theodore took possession of the deserted episcopal residence
at Cervione, where he assumed every mark of royal
dignity. He had his court, his guards, and his officers of
state; levied troops, coined money, instituted an order of
knighthood, and created nobility, among whom such names
as <i>Marchese</i> Giaffori and <i>Marchese</i> Paoli (Pasquale's father)
singularly figure. His manifesto, in answer to Genoese
proclamations denouncing his pretensions and painting
him as a charlatan, affected as great a sensitiveness of
insult as could exist in the mind of a Capet. For some
time all things went well; Theodore became master of
nearly the whole island except the Genoese fortresses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
which he blockaded. These were, in fact, the keys of the
island. But the succours which he had boasted of receiving
did not arrive, and, after employing various artifices to keep
alive the expectations of foreign aid and fresh supplies of
the muniments of war, finding, when he had held the
reins of power about eight months, that his new subjects
began to cool in their attachment to his person, and did
not act with the same ardour as before, he determined to go
over to the Continent, with the hope of obtaining the means
of carrying on the war, and thus reinstating himself in
the confidence of the Corsicans.</p>

<p>Appointing a regency to conduct the affairs of his kingdom
during his absence, he went to Holland, and, though
even his royal credit was probably at a discount, after long
delay, he succeeded in negotiating a considerable loan, at
what rate of interest or on what security we are not told.
However, a ship was freighted with cannon and other
warlike stores, on board of which he returned to Corsica
two years after he had quitted the island. But it was too
late; the French were then in possession of the principal
places, the patriot leaders were negotiating with them, and
the people had lost all confidence in their mock-king. Theodore
found, to use a colloquial expression, that &ldquo;the game
was up,&rdquo; and wisely retracing his steps, found his way
to England, the last refuge of abdicated monarchs.</p>

<p>Fortune still frowned on him. Pursued by his relentless
creditors, the ex-king was thrown into the King's Bench
prison. His distresses attracted the commiseration of
Horace Walpole, who, as Boswell informs us, &ldquo;wrote a
paper in the &#8216;World,&#8217; with great elegance and humour,
soliciting a contribution for the monarch in distress, to be
paid to Mr. Robert Dodsley, bookseller, as lord high treasurer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
This brought in a very handsome sum, and he was
allowed to get out of prison.&rdquo; &ldquo;Walpole,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;has
the original deed by which Theodore made over the kingdom
of Corsica in security to his creditors.&rdquo; Mr. Benson's
statement, which is more exact, and agrees with the epitaph,
is, that the subscription was not sufficient to extricate
King Theodore from his difficulties, and that he was
released from gaol as an insolvent debtor. However that
may be, he died soon afterwards. Former writers have
stated that he was buried in an obscure corner, among the
paupers, in the churchyard of St. Anne's, Westminster,
but they are mistaken. We find a neat mural tablet fixed
against the exterior wall of the church of St. Anne's,
Soho, at the west end, on which, surmounted by a coronet,
is inscribed the following epitaph, written by Horace
Walpole:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Environs of Olmeta.&mdash;Bandit-Life and the Vendetta&mdash;Its
Atrocities.&mdash;The Population disarmed.&mdash;The Bandits exterminated</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/077.jpg" width="500" height="312" alt="OLMETA." title="OLMETA." />
<p class="caption">OLMETA.</p>
</div>


<p>Olmeta stands, like most Corsican villages, on the point
of a hill, forming one side of an oval basin, the slopes of
which are laid out in terraced gardens and vineyards.
Here and there, in sheltered nooks, we find plantations of
orange-trees, now showing green fruit under their glossy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
leaves. Some fine chestnut and walnut trees about the
place, and the magnificent elms (<i>olme</i>) from which it
derives its name, soften the aspect of its bleak, exposed
site, and gaunt houses.</p>

<p>Charming as the natural landscapes are in Corsica, one
finds most of the villages, however picturesque at a distance,
on a nearer approach, a conglomeration of tall,
shapeless houses, black and frowning, with windows
guarded by rusty iron <i>grilles</i>, and generally unglazed.
Altogether, they look more like the holds of banditti
than the abodes of peaceful vinedressers; while the filth of
the purlieus is unutterable. Throwing open the double
casements of the widow's sanctum, I may not call it
boudoir, when I leapt out of bed to enjoy the fresh morning
air,&mdash;underneath was a noisome dunghill, grim gables
frowned on either hand, but beyond was the <i>riant</i> landscape
just described. Here truly God made the country,
man the town.</p>

<p>While my friend was sketching, I strolled up to the
pretty church we had seen by moonlight. Close by is a
large, roomy mansion, which belonged to Marshal Sebastiani.
He was a native of Olmeta, and, from an obscure
origin, arriving at high rank as well as great wealth,
partly, I understood, through a brilliant marriage, bought
a large property in the neighbourhood, which has been
recently sold for 150,000 francs to a French <i>Directeur</i>.
I went over the ch&acirc;teau: to the original mansion the
marshal had added a handsome <i>salle</i>, and a lofty tower
commanding varied and extensive views towards Fiorenzo
and the Mediterranean. My conductor was a gentleman
of Olmeta, who accidentally meeting me, proffered his
services, pressing me afterwards to take breakfast with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
him. We had done very well at the widow's long before,
with delicious bread, eggs, apples, and figs, and coffee in
the smallest of cups. We brewed our own tea in a bran-new
coffee-pot, purchased for that purpose at Bastia.
Butter and milk were wanting, but whipped eggs make a
very tolerable substitute for the latter.</p>

<p>My new acquaintance informed me that the decree,
passed the year before for disarming the whole population,
combined with measures for increasing the force of the
<i>gendarmerie</i>, and making it highly penal to harbour the
bandits or afford them any succour, had been actively and
rigorously carried out, and were completely successful.
The life of a citizen is as safe in Corsica as in any other
department of France. &ldquo;You may walk through the
island,&rdquo; added my informant, &ldquo;with a purse of gold in
your bosom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was true, I imagine, with regard to strangers, in
the worst of times; their security from molestation being
nearly allied to the national virtue of hospitality, which is
not quite extinct. Nor were the Corsican banditti associated,
like those of Italy, for the mere purpose of plunder,
though they have heavily taxed the peaceable inhabitants,
both by drawing from the poor the means for their subsistence
in the woods and mountains, and by levying,
under terror, direct contributions in money from the more
wealthy inhabitants in the towns and villages. These are,
however, but trifling ingredients in the mass of crime for
which Corsica has been so painfully distinguished. Would,
indeed, that robbery and pillage were the sins of the
darkest dye which have to be laid to the account of the
Corsican bandit! Most commonly, his hands have been
stained with innocent blood, shed recklessly, relentlessly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in private quarrels, often of the most frivolous description,
and not in open fight, as in the feuds of the middle ages,
not in the heat of sudden passion, but by cool, premeditated
murder.</p>

<p>Philippini, the best Corsican historian, who lived in the
sixteenth century, states that in his time 28,000 Corsicans
were murdered in the course of thirty years. A later
Corsican historian calculates that between the years 1683
and 1715, a period of thirty-two years, 28,715 murders
were perpetrated in Corsica; and he reckons that an equal
number were wounded. The average, then, in their days,
was about 900 souls yearly sent to their account by the
dagger and the <i>fusil</i> in murderous assaults; besides vast
multitudes who fell in the wars.</p>

<p>It was still worse in earlier ages; but those of which we
speak were times of high civilisation, and Corsica lay in
the centre of it. What do we find in recent times, up to
the very year before we visited the island?</p>

<p>I have before me the <i>Proc&egrave;s verbal</i> of the deliberations
of the Council General of the department of Corsica for
each of the years 1850, '51, and '52. From these I gather
that 4,300 <i>assassinats</i> had been perpetrated in Corsica since
1821; and, in the three years before mentioned, the
&ldquo;<i>Assassinats, ou tentatives d'assassiner</i>,&rdquo; averaged ninety-eight
annually from the 1st of January to the 1st of August,
to which day the annual reports are made up; so that,
reckoning for the remaining five months in the same proportion,
the list of these heinous crimes is brought up to
the fearful amount, for these days, of 160 in each year.</p>

<p>Well might M. le Pr&eacute;fet observe, in his address at the
opening of the session of 1851: &ldquo;<i>La situation du d&eacute;partement
&agrave; cet &eacute;gard est sans doute profond&eacute;ment triste. Le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
nombre des crimes n'a pas diminu&eacute; sensiblement</i>.&rdquo; So low,
however, is the moral sense in Corsica with regard to the
sanctity of human life, that these atrocities excite no
horror, and the sympathies of vast numbers of the population
are with the bandits. They are the heroes of the
popular tales and <i>canzoni</i>; one hears of them from one
end of the island to the other, round the watchfires of the
shepherds on the mountains, in the remote <i>pa&eacute;se</i>, by the
roadside. They are the tales of the nursery,&mdash;the Corsican
child learns, with his Ave Maria, that it is rightful
and glorious to take the life of any one who injures or
offends him.</p>

<p>To a passionate and imaginative people, these tales of
daring courage and wild adventure have an inconceivable
charm; though stained with blood, they are full of poetry
and romance. Such stories have been eagerly seized upon
by writers on Corsica,&mdash;they make excellent literary
capital. Unfortunately, <i>banditisme</i> forms so striking a
feature in Corsican history, that it must necessarily occupy
a conspicuous place in a faithful review of the genius and
manners of the people. There are doubtless traits of a
heroism worthy a better cause, and sometimes of a
redeeming humanity, in the lives of the banditti; but one
regrets to find, though happily not in the works of the
English travellers who have given accounts of Corsica, a
tendency to palliate so atrocious a system as blood-revenge.
<i>Vendetta</i>, the name given it, has a romantic sound; and
it is treated as a sort of national institution, originating in
high and laudable feelings, the injured sense of right, and
the love of family; so that, with the glory shed around it
by a false heroism, it is almost raised to the rank of a
virtue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>To take blood for blood, not by the hand of public
justice, but by the kinsmen of the slain, was, we are
reminded, a primitive custom, sanctioned by the usages of
many nations, and even by the laws of Moses. We know,
however, that among our Anglo-Saxon ancestors the laws
humanely commuted this right of revenge for fines commensurate
with the rank of the murdered person. But
while the Mosaic law forbad the acceptance of any pecuniary
compensation for the crime of manslaughter, and
expressly recognised the right of the &ldquo;avenger of blood&rdquo;
to exact summary vengeance, it provided for even the
murderer's security until he were brought to a fair trial.
But Corsica, alas! has had no &ldquo;Cities of Refuge,&rdquo; and
examples drawn from remote and barbarous times can
afford no apology for the inveterate cruelties of a people
enjoying the light of modern civilisation and professing
the religion of the New Testament.</p>

<p>The <i>vendetta</i> is also represented as a kind of rude justice,
to which the people were driven in the long ages of
misrule during which law was in abeyance or corruptly
administered. There is, no doubt, much truth in this as
applied to those times; but the prodigious amount of
human slaughter shown in the statistics just quoted, as
well as the continuance of this atrocious system to the
present day, long after the slightest shadow of any pretence
of legal injustice has vanished, seem to argue that
the ferocity which has shed such rivers of blood, if not
instinctive in the national character, at least found a soil
in which it took deep root.</p>

<p>For more than half a century, there can be no question
but, under a settled government, strict justice has been
done by the ordinary proceedings of the courts of law, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
all cases of injury to person or property, submitted to
them. But the turbulent Corsicans were ever impatient
of regular government&mdash;one great cause of their ultimate
degradation, not a little connected also with the growth of
<i>banditisme</i>; and the failure of justice has not lain with
the authorities, but with the population which harbours
and screens the criminals, and with the juries who refuse
to convict them.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The only other instance in the present day of crimes
similar to those which have been the scourge of Corsica,
is found in the case of unhappy Ireland. There, however,
the blood-revenge has been mostly confined to cases of
supposed agrarian grievances, and the number of victims
sacrificed to it is comparatively limited; more innocent
blood having been shed in Corsica in a single year, than
in Ireland during, perhaps, a quarter of a century.</p>

<p>The <i>vendetta</i>, is also palliated as vindicating wrongs for
which no courts of law, however upright, can afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
redress. Among the most polished nations, &ldquo;the point of
honour&rdquo; has been held to justify an injured man for challenging
his adversary to mortal combat. But the duel,
from its first origin among our Scandinavian ancestors,
savage as they were, and through all its forms, whether
legalised or treated as felonious, to its last shape in civilised
society, has nothing practically in common with the
Corsican <i>vendetta</i>. In the one, the appeal to arms has
always been tempered by a punctilious chivalry, which
recoiled from the slightest unfairness in the attendant circumstances;
in the other, the enemy is, if possible, taken
unawares, shot down by a cowardly miscreant lurking
behind a tree or a rock, or suddenly stabbed without an
opportunity of putting himself on his defence. The practice
of the <i>vendetta</i> is mere assassination.</p>

<p>Stript of the colouring shed round it by sentiment and
romance, <i>banditisme</i>, in its latter days at least, has been a
very common-place affair. Great numbers of the Corsicans,
too indolent to work, were happy to lead a vagabond
life, harbouring in the woods and mountains with a gun
on their shoulders, and as ready to shoot a man as a wild
beast. &ldquo;<i>C'est qu'en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>,&rdquo; said the Pr&eacute;fet, in the
address already quoted, &ldquo;<i>ces crimes proviennent moins du
banditisme que de la d&eacute;plorable habitude de marcher toujours
arm&eacute;s, par suite de laquelle les moindres rixes d&eacute;g&eacute;n&egrave;rent
si souvent en attentats contre la vie.</i>&rdquo; One hears
continually for what trifles assassinations have been perpetrated;
and a recent traveller informs us that his life
was threatened for having merely resisted the extortionate
demand of his guide to the mountains.</p>

<p>The hardships to which the bandit is exposed in his wild
life in the <i>maquis</i> cannot be much greater than those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the shepherd who, from fear or favour, shares with him
his chestnuts, his goat's milk, and cheese. The <i>gendarmes</i>,
indeed, are sometimes on his track, but there is stirring
adventure in eluding their pursuit, triumph in the ambuscade
to which they become victims, glory even in death
heroically met. With all its perils and hardships, such a
life of lawless independence has its charms; and the bandit
knows that his memory will be honoured, and his death,
if possible, revenged. But who laments the unfortunate
<i>gendarme</i> who falls in these encounters? Who pities the
widow and orphans of men as bold, resolute, and enterprising
as those against whom they are matched? In the
tales of banditti life, the ministers of justice are <i>sbirri</i>,
conventionally a term of disgrace; all the sympathy is
with the culprit against whom the <i>gendarmerie</i> peril their
lives in an arduous service.</p>

<p>The brigands must live by plunder in one shape or
another. It is not likely that bands of armed men, the
terror of a whole neighbourhood, would be always content
with the mere subsistence wrung from the scanty resources
of the poor shepherds. Not that they robbed on the highways;
it answered better to levy contributions, under
pain of death, from such of the defenceless inhabitants as
were able to pay them. Mr. Benson tells a story of one
of the most celebrated of the bandit chiefs, who levied
black mail in the wild districts bordering on the forest of
Vizzavona.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leaving Vivario, we heard from the lips of the poor
<i>cur&eacute;</i>, that Galluchio and his followers were in the <i>maquis</i>
of a range of mountains to our right. The <i>cur&eacute;</i> was
busy in his vineyard when we passed, but as soon as he
recognised our French companion, he left his work for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
few moments to join us. &#8216;Sir,&#8217; said he, addressing himself
to M. Cottard, &#8216;I feel myself in imminent danger;
Galluchio and his band are in yonder mountains, and only
a few evenings ago I received a peremptory message from
him, requiring 300 francs, and threatening my speedy
assassination should I delay many days to comply with his
demand. I have not the money, and I have sent for some
military to protect me.&#8217;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>There is reason to believe that these forced contributions
have not diminished since Mr. Benson's journey. We
were told of a case in which a wealthy man, having received
notice to pay 10,000 francs, under penalty of being
shot, was so terrified, that after shutting himself up in his
house for a year in constant alarm, his health and spirits
became so shattered by the state of continual terror and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
watchfulness in which he lived, that he sank under it, and
was carried out dead. In another case, a young man of
more resolute character was called upon for 1000 francs,
and having no ready money, was allowed three months to
raise it, on giving his bill for security. He armed himself,
and went to the appointed rendezvous. The brigand was
waiting for him; he made him lay down his arms, and
searched him. The young man had filled his pockets with
chestnuts, and had contrived to secrete a small pistol
about his person, which escaped discovery. The brigand,
producing paper and ink, ordered his victim to draw the
bill. The young man excused himself on the ground that
he was so frightened, and his hand trembled so that he could
not write;&mdash;he would sign the bill if the other drew it
out. The brigand knelt down by the side of a flat stone
to do so. Meanwhile the young man walked up and
down eating his chestnuts, and throwing the shells carelessly
away. Some of them struck the brigand. &ldquo;What
are you doing?&rdquo; said he, startled. &ldquo;Eating my chestnuts;&rdquo;
and he took out another handful. Occasionally
he stopped and looked down on the bandit while engaged
in writing; still, with apparent <i>sang froid</i>, munching his
chestnuts. Presently the bill was finished; he pretended
to look it over, found some error, which he pointed out,
and while the brigand stooped to correct it, drew his concealed
pistol and shot him through the head.&mdash;The so-called
<i>vendetta</i> has shrunk more and more to the level of
vulgar crime. It is even notorious that bandits have become
hired assassins, employed by others to take off persons
against whom they had a grudge,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>mais plus pour
amiti&eacute; que pour argent</i>,&rdquo; said my informant, giving the
fact the most favourable turn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems surprising that such enormities should have
been permitted in a European country, at an advanced
period of the nineteenth century. Could a strong national
government have been established in Corsica&mdash;which,
however, seems to have been impracticable with so lawless
and factious a people&mdash;its first duty would have been, as
was the case under Pascal Paoli's administration, to give
security to life, <i>co&ucirc;te que co&ucirc;te</i>. The successive Governments
of France appear to have been too much occupied
by their own affairs to pay any regard to the social
state of their Corsican department, flagrant as was the
disgrace it reflected on them. Perhaps they were impressed
with the idea that the passion of revenge, the
thirst for blood, were so inherent in the native character,
that law and force were alike powerless, and the <i>vendetta</i>
could only be extirpated by a moral change more to be
hoped for than expected. Thus speaks the Pr&eacute;fet, in his
inaugural address of 1851:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Ici, messieurs, vous en
conviendrez, l'administration est sans force. C'est &agrave; la
religion seule qu'appartient la touchante pr&eacute;rogative de
pr&ecirc;cher l'oubli des injures:</i>&rdquo; and a traveller who spent
some time in the island during the year following, gives
the result of his observations in the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;There
is probably no other means of certainly putting
down the blood-revenge, murder, and bandit-life, than
culture; and culture advances in Corsica but slowly.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The same author says of the general disarming, proposed
in 1852: &ldquo;Whether, and how, this will be capable
of execution, I know not. It will cost mischief enough in
the execution; for they will not be able to disarm the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
banditti at the same time, and their enemies will then be
exposed, unarmed, to their bullets.&rdquo; These doubts and
forebodings are proved to have been imaginary. It might
have been long, indeed, before preaching and moral culture
had eradicated evils so deeply rooted in the genius of the
people. In such an extreme case, the exercise of a despotic
power was required to put an end to the reign of terror
and blood which has desolated this fair island for so many
centuries. One bold stroke has broken the spell; the measures
adopted for the suppression of <i>banditisme</i> have completely
succeeded. &ldquo;The prisons are full,&rdquo; said my informant;
&ldquo;in the last year, 400 of the brigands have been
sentenced or shot down, and as many more driven out of
the country: the land is at peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only wonder is that the experiment was not tried
before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>We found that no mules could be hired at Olmeta, and
intending to wander for a few days in the neighbouring
valleys, and on the skirts of the mountainous district of
Nebbio, though we preferred walking, were at some loss
how to get forward our baggage. The Bastia muleteer was
dismissed, and as we were travelling somewhat at our ease,
the luggage was more than could be conveniently carried.
In this dilemma, Antoine proffered the services of himself
and the mule which had done its work so well the evening
before. His offer was readily accepted, and we had much
reason to be pleased with the change we had made in our
conductor. Antoine relieved us from all care as to our
baggage and entertainment, knew the roads, and where we
could best put up, had by heart many a story of times past,
and something to tell of all the places we visited, and,
having been a rover himself, entered into the spirit of our
rambles: altogether, as I have observed before, Antoine
was an excellent specimen of a Capo Corso peasant. To
be sure, he had killed his man, but that was in a <i>duello</i>,
according to Corsican ideas; as singular, if one may jest on

duel.</p>

<p>The valleys of Olmeta, Oletta, and some others, form a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
sort of basin between the mountains bounding the <i>littorale</i>,
already spoken of, and the Serra di Tenda, a noble range
in the western line of the principal chain. Broken by
numberless hills, the whole basin is a scene of fertile
beauty, similar to the picture drawn of Olmeta&mdash;vineyards,
olive-grounds and gardens, orange, citron, fig,
almond, apple, and pear-trees, clustering at every turn
with groups of magnificent chestnut-trees, and alternating
with spots devoted to tillage. The country people were
now sowing wheat or preparing the ground with most
primitive ploughs, of the Roman fashion, drawn sometimes
by a single ox or mule. Patches, on which the
green blade was already springing, showed that it is the
practice to sow wheat as soon as possible after the autumnal
rains.</p>

<p>Retracing our steps of the preceding night nearly to the
summit of the pass, under the persuasion that it commanded
a fine prospect, we turned to the right, and strolled
along a terrace above the broad valley through which the
Bevinco flows into
the Stagno di Biguglia,
somewhat below
the point at which
we left it. Looking
backward, we had
a charming peep at
the Mediterranean
through a gorge in
the mountains, with
the lonely island of
Monte-Cristo, seen
from this point of view detached from the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
group of islands to which it belongs. Across the valley
was a range of mountains, a branch of the central chain
dividing it from that of the Golo. Mists hung about
them, pierced by the Cima dei Taffoni, the most elevated
point of the range, which rose magnificently, being about
3000 feet high, twenty miles to the south-east. The
ridge along which we strolled was covered partly by
patches of the never-failing evergreen shrubbery, rendered
more beautiful by the quantities of cyclamen, one of the
prettiest plants we have in our greenhouses at home, now
in full flower under the shelter of the arbutus and other
shrubs. Small flocks of sheep, all black, and no larger
than our Welsh mountain breed, were browsing among the
barren patches of heath, and sometimes crossed our path,
with their tinkling bells. There was a slight shower; but
it soon cleared off, and the sun shone out, and the air and
surface of the ground, cooled and freshened by the gentle
rain, were in the best state for the continuation of our
rambles.</p>

<p>The cultivation, as may be supposed, is indolent and
imperfect, the surface being merely scratched, and little
care taken to free it of weeds. We need not, therefore,
be surprised at finding that the average produce of the
wheat-crop throughout Corsica is only an increase of nine
on the seed sown. Of maize, or Indian corn, it is thirty-eight
or forty.</p>

<p>The canton of Oletta is called by the Corsicans &ldquo;the
pearl of the Nebbio.&rdquo; It contains two or three hamlets,
the principal village seeming to hang on the rocky slope
of a hill, embowered in fruit trees. The olive flourishes
particularly well here; and Oletta takes its name from its
olive-trees, as Olmeta does from its elms. Many of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
are of great age and size, and, with their silvery leaves,
have a soft and pleasing effect, especially when contrasted
with the richer foliage of the spreading chestnut-trees.
The olive-yards are neatly dug and kept clear of weeds;
and we observed that the soil was drawn round the stems
of the trees, probably in well-manured heaps, such a
produce as the olive truly requiring to feed on the fat of
the land. The berries were now full formed, but had not
begun to fall. I believe they hang till Christmas, when
they are collected, and carried to the vats. When pressed,
twenty pounds of olives yield five of pure oil. It is stored
in large pottery jars, and forms the principal export from
Corsica; this district, with the Balagna and the neighbourhood
of Bonifaccio, producing the largest quantity.
An inferior sort of oil is used in the lamps throughout the
island; the lamps being of glass, with tall stems containing
the oil, and crowned by a socket, through which the cotton
burner is passed, and having nothing of the antique or
classical about them. The birds scattering the berries in
all directions, and carrying them to great distances, the
number of wild olive-trees is immense. An attempt was
made to count them, by order of the Government, in 1820,
with a view to foster so valuable a source of national
wealth by the encouragement of grafting; and it is said
that as many as twelve millions of wild olive-trees were
then counted.</p>

<p>There is a story of love and heroism connected with
Oletta. One hears such tales everywhere in Corsica&mdash;by
the wayside, at the shepherd's watch-fire, lying in the
shade, or basking in the sun. Antoine was an excellent
<i>raconteur</i>; so are all such vagabonds. I possess a collection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of these tales by Renucci, published at Bastia<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, and
proposed to interweave some of them into my narrative.
They may be worked up, with invention and embellishment,
into pretty romances; but that is not our business.
In Renucci, we have stories of <i>Ospitalit&agrave;</i>, <i>Magnanimit&agrave;</i>,
<i>Fedelt&agrave;</i>, <i>Probit&agrave;</i>, <i>Generosit&agrave;</i>, <i>Incorruttibilit&agrave;</i>, all the virtues
under the sun with names ending in <i>t&agrave;</i>, and many
others. One wearies of the eternal laudation lavished on
these islanders, not only by their own writers, but by all
travellers, from Boswell downwards.</p>

<p>The story of the heroine of Oletta is told by Renucci<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>,
and, more simply, by Marmocchi.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> During the occupation
of Capo Corso by the French, in 1751, some of the villagers
were sentenced to be broken on the wheel for
a conspiracy to seize the place, which was garrisoned by
the French; their bodies were exposed on the scaffold,
and their friends prohibited, under severe penalties, from
giving them Christian burial. But a young woman, <i>giovinetta
scelta e robusta</i>, as she must have been to perform
the exploit assigned to her in the tale, eluded the sentries,
and, taking the body of her lover, one of the conspirators
executed, on her shoulders, carried it off. The general
in command, struck by her exalted virtue, pardons the
offence, and she is borne home in triumph amidst the
shouts of the villagers.</p>

<p>All honour to the French marquis for his gallantry to a
woman, though his tactics were somewhat savage for the
reign of Louis XVI.; and all glory to Maria Gentili of
Oletta, stout of heart and strong of limb, fit to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
wife and mother of bandits; still better, to have fought at
Borgo, where Corsican women, in male attire, with sword
and gun, rushed forward in the ranks of the island militia
which triumphantly defeated a French army, composed of
some of the finest troops in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>But let us proceed with our rambles; and, before we
change the scene from the region of the vine and the
orange to that of the chestnut and ilex, a short digression
on the climatic zones of Corsica may not be out of
place.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/095.jpg" width="500" height="312" alt="BETWEEN OLMETA AND BIGORNO."
title="BETWEEN OLMETA AND BIGORNO." />
<p class="caption">BETWEEN OLMETA AND BIGORNO.</p>
</div>

<p>The island may be divided, as to climate and vegetation,
into three zones, corresponding with the degrees of elevation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of its surface. The <i>first</i>, ranging to about 1,700 feet
above the level of the Mediterranean, and embracing the
deeper valleys of the island, as well as the sea-coast, has
the characteristics conformable to its latitude; that is to
say, similar to those of the parallel shores of Italy and
Spain. Properly speaking, there is no winter; they have
but two seasons, spring and summer. The thermometer
seldom falls more than a degree or two below the freezing
point, and then only for a few hours. The nights are,
however, cold at all seasons.</p>

<p>When we were at Ajaccio, towards the end of October,
the heat was oppressive; my thermometer at noon stood
at 80&deg; in the shade, in an airy room closed by Venetian
blinds. In January, we were told, the sun becomes again
powerful, and then for eight months succeeds a torrid
heat. The sky is generally cloudless, the thermometer
rises from 70 to 80 and even 90 degrees in the shade, and
scarcely any rain falls after the month of April; nor indeed
always then, so that there are often long and excessive
droughts.</p>

<p>The indigenous vegetation is generally of a class suited
to resist the droughts, having hard, coriaceous leaves.
Such is the shrubbery described in a former chapter,
which, exempt from severe frosts on the one hand, and
thriving in an arid soil and parching heat on the other,
clothes half the surface of the island with perpetual
verdure. There have been seasons when even these
shrubs were so burnt up that the slightest accident might
have caused a wide-spread conflagration. When we travelled,
the leaves of the rock-roses, which here grow to
the height of four or five feet, were hanging on the bushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
scorched and withered by the summer heat, somewhat
marring the beauty of the evergreen thickets.</p>

<p>Most of the fruit-trees suited to flourish in such a
climate have been already noticed in passing. We saw
also almonds, pomegranates, and standard peaches and
apricots. To the list of shrubs which most struck us, I
may also add the brilliant flowering oleander, and the
tamarisk. Corsica is said to be famous for its orchids,
verbenas, and cotyledinous and caryophyllaceous plants;
but I only speak of what I saw, and these were out of
season.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> zone ranges from about 2000 feet to between
5000 and 6000 feet above the level of the Mediterranean,
the climate corresponding with that of the central
districts of France. The temperature is, however,
very variable, and its changes are sudden. Frost and
snow make their appearance in November, and often last
for fifteen or twenty days together. It is remarked, that
frost does not injure the olive-trees up to the level of about
3800 feet; and snow even renders them more fruitful.</p>

<p>The chestnut appears to be the characteristic feature in
the vegetation of this zone. Thriving also among hills
and valleys of a lower elevation, here it spreads into
extensive woods, till at the height of about 6000 feet it is
exchanged for the pine, and Marmocchi says<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, I think incorrectly,
<i>c&egrave;de la place</i> to the oak and the <i>beech</i>. We certainly
found the oak, both evergreen (ilex) and deciduous,
growing very freely and in extensive woods in close contiguity
with the chestnut at an elevation far below the
limit of the <i>second</i> zone, as well as mixed with the pine in
the forest of Vizzavona, also below that limit. But, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
my own observation, I should class the oak of both kinds
among the trees belonging to the second zone, though the
chestnut is its most characteristic feature; and should
much doubt its flourishing at the height of between 6000
and 7000 feet above the sea-level,&mdash;still more the beech.
The highest point at which we found the beech was the
Col di Vizzavona, on the road from Vivario to Bocagnono,
3435 feet above the level of the Mediterranean, and I was
surprised to see it flourishing there.</p>

<p>While the principal cities and towns in Corsica stand
within the limits of the first zone, it is in the second that
by far the greatest part of the population live,&mdash;dispersed,
as we have often had occasion to remark, in valleys and
hamlets placed on the summits or ridges of hills. The
choice of such positions is a necessary condition of health,
as in this region, no less than in the former, the valleys
are notorious for the insalubrity of the air.</p>

<p>The <i>third</i> zone, ranging from an elevation of about
6000 feet to the summits of the highest mountains, is a
region of storms and tempests during eight months of the
year; but during the short summer the air is said to be
generally serene, and the sky unclouded. This elevated
region has, of course, no settled inhabitants, but during
the fine season the shepherds occupy cabins on its verge,
their sheep and goats browsing among the dwarf bushes
on the mountain sides. The vegetation is scanty. Even
the pine cannot thrive at such an elevation, and the birch,
which one generally finds, though dwarf, still higher up
the mountains, I did not happen to see in Corsica, though
it is mentioned in <i>Marmocchi's</i> list of indigenous trees.</p>

<p>The summits of the Monte Rotondo and Monte d'Oro
are capped with snow at all seasons, and beautiful are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
snowy peaks, piercing the blue heavens in the sunny region
of the Mediterranean, and well does the glistening tiara,
marking from afar their pre-eminence among the countless
domes and peaks which cluster round them, or break the
outline of a long chain, assist the eye in computing their
relative heights. We had no opportunity of ascertaining
how low perpetual snow hangs on the sides of the highest
Corsican mountains. According to M. Arago, Monte Rotondo
is 2762 <i>m&egrave;tres</i> (about 8976 feet) above the level of
the sea; and he says that there are seven others exceeding
2000 <i>m&egrave;tres</i> (about 6500 feet). Among these must be
included Monte d'Oro, which figures in Marmocchi's list
at 2653 <i>m&egrave;tres</i>, or about 8622 feet. The season was too
late for our making an ascent with any prospect of advantage;
but at that time of the year (the end of October)
none of the peaks we saw, except the two named, though
some of them are only from 500 to 800 feet lower than
Monte d'Oro, had snow upon them.</p>

<p>While rounding the base of Monte d'Oro, we observed
long streaks on the side of the cone, descending, perhaps,
1000 feet below the compact mass on the summit; but
they had the appearance of fresh-fallen snow, and from
our observing that all the other summits were free from
snow, I am inclined to assign the height of about 7500
or 8000 feet above the level of the Mediterranean as the
line of perpetual snow in Corsica.</p>

<p>In Norway, between 59&deg;-62&deg; N. latitude, we calculated
it at about 4500 feet on the average, the line varying
considerably in different seasons. In the summer of 1849
there was snow on the shores of the Mi&ouml;s-Vand, which are
under 3000 feet, while the summer before the lakes on
the table-land of the Hardanger Fjeld, 4000 feet high,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
were free from ice, and throughout the passage of the
Fjeld the surface covered with snow was less than that
which was bare. In 1849, crossing the Hardanger from
Vinje to Odde, the whole of the plateau was a continued
field of snow.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Taking the entire mountain system of
central Norway, from the Gousta-Fjeld to Sneeh&aelig;ttan and
the H&ouml;rungurne, with elevations of from 5000 to near
8000 feet, the average of the snow-level may be taken, as
before observed, at about 4500 feet; that of the Corsican
mountains, with elevations of from 6000 to nearly 9000
feet, being, as we have seen, from 7000 to 8000 feet.</p>

<p>In Switzerland, where the elevations are so much
greater, the snow-line varies from 8000 to 8800 feet
above the level of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> On Mont Blanc it is stated
to be 8500 feet. The height differs on the northern and
southern faces of the chain within those portions of the
Alps that run east and west, but 8500 feet may be taken
as the average.</p>

<p>We may be surprised to find that congelation rests at
the same, or nearly the same, level in the Alps of Switzerland,
and on the Corsican mountains eight degrees further
south. But difference of latitude is no determinate rule
for calculating the level to which the line of perpetual
snow descends. There are other influences to be taken
into the account, such as the duration and intensity of
summer heats, the comparative dryness of climate, the
extent of the snow-clad surface in the system generally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and more especially the height and exposure of particular
mountains.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Thus the snow-line on the southern slope of
the Alps is in some cases as high as 9500 feet. It may be
conceived that as the great extent of snow-clad surface on
the high Fjelds of Norway so much depresses the level of
the snow-line in that country, so the great superincumbent
mass resting on the summits of the higher Alps has a
similar effect, reducing the average snow-line in Switzerland
to nearly that of the Corsican mountains. The
wonder is that Monte Rotondo and Monte d'Oro,&mdash;rising
from a chain surrounded by the Mediterranean, in insulated
peaks of no very considerable height, without glaciers
or snowy basins to reduce the temperature,&mdash;should, in a
climate where the sun's heat is excessive for eight months
of the year, have snow on their summits in the months
of July and August. I have observed the <i>Pico di Teyde</i>
in Teneriffe with no snow upon it in the first days of
November, though it is 3000 feet higher than Monte
Rotondo, and only five degrees further south. Mount
&AElig;tna, also, nearly 11,000 feet high, in about the same
latitude as the Peak of Teneriffe (37&deg; N.), is free from perpetual
snow; but that may arise from local causes.</p>

<p>Murato, a large, scattered village, which formerly gave
its name to a <i>pi&egrave;ve</i>, and is now the <i>chef-lieu</i> of a canton,
stands on the verge of a woody and mountainous district.
Just before entering the village, we were struck by the
superior character of the <i>fa&ccedil;ade</i> of a little solitary church
by the roadside. We afterwards learnt that it was dedicated
to St. Michael, and reckoned one of the most
remarkable churches in the island, having been erected
by the Pisans, before the Genoese established themselves
in Corsica. The <i>fa&ccedil;ade</i> is constructed of alternate courses
of black and white marble, and put me in mind of the
magnificent cathedrals of Pisa and Sienna, of which it is
a model in miniature. Indeed, most of the churches in
Corsica are built on these and similar Italian models,
though few of them with such chaste simplicity of design
as this little roadside chapel.</p>

<p>The smiling aspect of the vine-clad hills, umbrageous
fruit-orchards, and silvery olive-groves of the canton of
Oletta now changed for a bolder landscape and wilder
accompaniments. Soon after leaving Murato, the ilex
began to appear, scattered among rough brakes, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
sharp descent led down to the Bevinco, here a mountain-torrent,
hurrying along through deep banks, tufted
with underwood, the box, which grows largely in Corsica,
being profusely intermixed. The road&mdash;like all the other
byroads, merely a horse-track&mdash;crosses the stream by a
bold arch.</p>

<p>Immediately in front of the bridge stands a pyramidal
rock, remarkable for all its segments having the same
character, and for the way in which evergreen shrubs hang
from the fissures in graceful festoons, contrasting with
some gigantic gourds, in a small cultivated patch at the
foot of the rock, and sloping down to the edge of the
stream.</p>

<p>Higher up we entered the first chestnut wood we had
yet seen. At the outskirts it had all the character of a
natural wood; the trees were irregularly massed, and
many of them of great age and vast dimensions. Further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
on they stood in rows, this tree being extensively planted
in Corsica for the sake of the fruit. We were just in the
right season for this important harvest, it being now ripe,
and the ground under the trees was thickly strewed with
the brown nuts bursting from their husky shells.</p>

<p>It being about noon, we halted in the shade by the
side of a little rill, trickling among the trees into the
river beneath, to rest and lunch. Nothing could be more
delightful, after a long walk in the sun; for the temperature
of the valleys is high even at this season. Antoine
had charge of a basket of grapes, with a loaf of bread
and a bottle of the excellent Frontigniac of Capo Corso;
to these were added handfuls of chestnuts, so sweet and
tender when perfectly fresh; so that, tempering our wine in
the cool stream, we fared luxuriously.</p>

<p>While we sip our wine and munch our chestnuts, seasoned
by talk with Antoine, the reader may like to hear
something of a crop which is of more importance than
might be supposed in the agricultural statistics of Corsica.</p>

<p>There are several cantons, Murato being one of the
principal, in which the chestnut woods, either natural or
planted, are so extensive that the districts have acquired
the name of <i>Pa&eacute;se di Castagniccia</i>. The Corsican peasant
seldom sets forth on a journey without providing himself
with a bag of chestnuts, and with these and a gourd of
wine or of water slung by his side, he is never at a loss.
Eaten raw or roasted on the embers, chestnuts form,
during half the year, the principal diet of the herdsmen
and shepherds on the hills, and of great numbers of the
poorer population in the districts where the tree flourishes.
They are also made into puddings, and served up in various
other ways. It is said that in the canton of Alesanni, one
of the Castagniccia districts just referred to, on the occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of a peasant making a feast at his daughter's marriage,
no less than twenty-two dishes have been prepared from
the meal of the chestnut.</p>

<p>I recollect that the innkeeper at Bonifaccio, boasting
his culinary skill, said that he could dress a potato sixteen
different ways, and though we earnestly entreated him not
to give himself the trouble of making experiments not
suited to our taste, it was with great difficulty, and after
several failures, we made him comprehend that an Englishman
preferred but one way&mdash;and that was &ldquo;<i>au
naturel</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cultivation of the potato has made considerable
advance in Corsica, and there are now seventeen or eighteen
hundred acres annually planted with it. But in many
parts of the island the chestnut fills the same place which
the potato once occupied in the dietary of the Irish peasant.
A political economist would find no difficulty in
deciding that in both cases the results have been similar,
and much to be lamented. Indeed, the Corsican fruit is
still more adapted to cherish habits of indolence than the
Irish root, as the chestnut does not even require the brief
exertion, either in cultivation or cookery, which the potato
does. It drops, I may say, into the Corsican's mouth, and
living like the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Prisca gens mortalium.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;the primitive race of mortals,&rdquo; of whom the poet sings,
who ran about in the woods, eating acorns and drinking
water, the Corsicans are, for the most part, satisfied with
their chestnuts literally &ldquo;<i>au naturel</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most French writers on Corsica declare war against the
chestnut-trees for the encouragement they afford to a life
of idleness, and M. de Beaumont does not scruple to assert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
that a tempest which levelled them all with the ground
would, in the end, prove a great blessing. There is some
truth in these opinions, but humanity shudders at the
misery such a catastrophe&mdash;like the potato blight, which
truly struck at the root of the evil in Ireland&mdash;would
entail on tens of thousands of the poor Corsicans, to whom
the chestnut is the staff of life. In the interests of that
humanity, as well as from our deep love and veneration
for these noble woods, we say, God forbid!</p>

<p>Many years ago, an attempt was made to discountenance
the growth of chestnuts, by prohibiting their plantation
in soils capable of other kinds of cultivation; but shortly
afterwards the decree was revoked on the report of no less
a political economist than the celebrated Turgot.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> <i>Vivent
donc ces ch&acirc;taigniers magnifiques, quand m&ecirc;me!</i> And may
the Corsicans learn not to abuse the gifts which Providence
gratuitously showers from their spreading boughs!</p>

<p>Our <i>al fresco</i> repast on chestnuts and grapes being concluded,
we left Antoine to load his mule, which had been
grazing in the cool shade, and following a track through
the wood, it became so steep that we soon gained a very
considerable elevation. Of this we were more sensible
when, turning round, we found that our range of sight
embraced one of the finest views imaginable. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
distance, the long chain of mountains intersecting Capo
Corso appeared grouped in one central mass, with their
rocky summits and varied outlines more or less boldly defined,
as they receded from the point of view. The western
coast of the peninsula stretched far away to the northward,
broken by a succession of mountainous ridges, branching
out from the central chain, and having their bases washed
by the Mediterranean, point after point appealing in perspective.</p>

<p class="caption">CAPO CORSO FROM THE CHESTNUT WOODS.</p>
</div>

<p>Of these indentations in the coast, the nearest, as well as
the most important, is the Gulf of San Fiorenzo, one of the
finest harbours in the Mediterranean. The town stands
on a hill, above the marshy delta of the Aliso, the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of which we could trace through the most extended of
these high valleys. Close beneath our standing point, as
it appeared, lay the basin of Oletta, with its villages on
the hill-tops, and its gentle eminences, with slopes and
hollows richly clothed, now grouped together like the
mountain ranges above, but in softer forms. This view,
whether as partially seen in our first position through the
glades and under the branching canopy of the chestnut
wood, or shortly afterwards, still better, from a more
commanding point on the summit of the ridge, had all the
advantages which the most exquisite colouring, and the
finest atmospheric effects could lend. Indeed, I felt persuaded,
that the extraordinary richness of the warm tints
on some of the mountain sides was not merely an atmospheric
effect, but aided by the natural colour of the
formation.</p>

<p>The whole country lying beneath, the ancient province
of Nebbio, with the Gulf of San Fiorenzo for its outlet,
guarded by the mountain ridges and embracing the districts
of Oletta, Murato, and Sorio, is of such importance
in a strategical view, that the fate of Corsica has often
been decided by campaigns conducted on this ground; and
it is said that whatever power obtains possession of it,
will sooner or later become masters of the whole island.</p>

<p>San Fiorenzo, a fortified place, was bombarded in 1745
by an English fleet acting in concert with the King of
Sardinia for the support of the Corsicans against the
Genoese, and on the surrender of the place it was given up
to the patriots. Then first the British Government interfered
in Corsican affairs; but shortly afterwards, when
some of the patriot leaders sent emissaries to Lord Bristol,
our ambassador at the court of Turin, offering to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
themselves under the protection of the English Government,
the court of St. James's, deterred probably by the
jealousies then subsisting among the supporters of the
patriotic cause, civilly declined the offer, and withdrew
their fleet. Having thus lost by their own misconduct
the powerful co-operation of England, the Corsicans, left
to their own resources, after a long and determined struggle,
at length yielded to a power with which they were unable
to cope.</p>

<p>San Fiorenzo was again the scene of British intervention,
when the Corsicans, throwing off in 1793 the yoke of the
French revolutionary government, applied to Lord Hood,
the commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, for assistance.
In consequence, Nelson, then commanding the
&ldquo;Agamemnon,&rdquo; and cruising off the island with a small
squadron, to prevent the enemy from throwing in supplies,
made a sudden descent on San Fiorenzo, where he landed
with 120 men. Close to the port the French had a storehouse
of flour adjoining their only mill, Nelson threw
the flour into the sea, burnt the mill, and re-embarked in
the face of 1000 men and some gun-boats, which opened
fire upon him. In the following spring, five English regiments
were landed in the island under General Dundas,
and Lieutenant-Colonel (afterwards Sir John) Moore
having taken possession of the heights overlooking the
port of San Fiorenzo, the French found themselves unable
to hold the place, and sinking one of their frigates, and
burning another, retreated to Bastia.</p>

<p>Nelson's dashing enterprise was succeeded by another
of far greater moment, characteristic of the times when
our old 74's had not been superseded by costly screw
three-deckers, and our naval commanders, though not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
wanting in discretion, acted on the impulses of their own
brave hearts, without any very nice calculations of responsibilities
and possible consequences.</p>

<p>On a <i>reconnaissance</i> made by Nelson on the 19th of
February, when he drove the French under shelter of their
works, it appeared that the defences of Bastia were strong.
Besides the citadel, mounting thirty pieces of cannon and
eight mortars, with seventy embrasures counted in the
town-wall near the sea, there were four stone redoubts
on the heights south of the town, and two or three others
further in advance; one a new work, with guns mounted <i>en
barbette</i>. A frigate, &ldquo;La Fl&egrave;che,&rdquo; lay in the harbour, but
dismasted; her guns were removed to the works. These
works were held by 1000 regular troops, 1500 national
guards, and a large body of Corsicans, making a total of
4000 men under arms.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>To attack this formidable force, manning such defences,
Nelson could only muster 218 marines, 787 troops of the
line under orders to serve as such, the admiral insisting
on having them restored to this service, 66 men of the
Royal Artillery, and 112 Corsican chasseurs, making a
total of 1183 troops. To these were added 250 sailors.
Meanwhile, the English general made a <i>reconnaissance</i> in
force from San Fiorenzo, and retired without attempting
to strike a blow, though he had 2000 of the finest troops
in the world lying idle; declaring that the enterprise was
so rash that no officer would be justified in undertaking it.
He even refused to furnish Lord Hood with a single soldier,
cannon, or store.</p>

<p>The Admiral replied, that he was most willing to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
upon himself the whole responsibility, and Nelson, nothing
daunted, landed his small force on the 9th of April, three
miles from the town, and the siege operations commenced.
Encamping near a high rock, 2500 yards from the citadel,
and the seamen working hard for several days in throwing
up works, making roads, and carrying up ammunition, the
fire was opened on the 12th of the same month. The
works of the besiegers were mounted with four 13-inch
and 10-inch mortars, an 18-inch howitzer, five 24-pounder
guns, and two 18-pounder carronades. I give these details
in order to show with what small means the daring enterprise
was accomplished.</p>

<p>Lord Hood had sent in a flag of truce, summoning the
city to surrender; to which M. La Combe St. Michel, the
Commissioner of the National Convention, replied, &ldquo;that
he had red-hot shot for our ships and bayonets for our
troops, and when two-thirds of his men were killed, he
would trust to the generosity of the English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The place being now regularly invested, there was heavy
firing on both sides, &ldquo;the seamen minding shot,&rdquo; as Nelson
characteristically wrote to his wife, &ldquo;no more than peas.&rdquo;
The besiegers' works were advanced, first to 1600 yards,
and afterwards to a ridge 900 yards from the citadel; and
on the 19th of May, thirty-five days after the fire was
opened, the enemy offered to capitulate. The same evening,
while the terms were negotiating, the advanced guard
of the troops from San Fiorenzo made their appearance
on the hills above the place, and on the following
morning the whole army, under the command of General
D'Aubant, who had succeeded Dundas, arrived just in
time to take possession of Bastia.</p>

<p>Nelson had anticipated this, for in a letter to his wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
written during the siege, he says, &ldquo;My only fear is, that
the soldiers will advance when Bastia is about to surrender,
and deprive our handful of brave men of part of their
glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the work was already done, and Nelson writes after
the surrender of the place, &ldquo;I am all astonishment when
I reflect on what we have achieved.&rdquo; A force of 4000 men
in strong defences had laid down their arms to 1200
soldiers, marines, and British seamen.</p>

<p>The political results of these operations, which for the
time numbered the Corsicans among the willing subjects
of the British crown, will claim a short notice on a fitting
opportunity. History is not our province, but a traveller
may be allowed to trace the footsteps of his countrymen
during their brief occupation of a soil fiercely trodden by
all the European nations; and, on a standing point between
Fiorenzo and Bastia, naturally lingers for a moment on a
feat of arms memorable among our naval exploits in the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>After leaving the chestnut woods, the wildness of the
scene increased at every step. Our track skirted a forest
of ilex spreading far up the base of the mountains, and
filling the glens below, round the gorges of which the path
led. The trees were of all ages, from the young growth,
with a shapely <i>contour</i> of silvery grey foliage, to the gigantic
patriarchs of the forest, spreading their huge limbs, hoar
with lichens, in most fantastic and often angular forms,
and their boles black and rugged with the growth of centuries.
Some were rifted by the tempests, and bared their
scathed and bleached tops to the winds of heaven. Others
had yielded to the storms or age, and lay prostrate on the
ground, charred and blackened by the fires which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
shepherds in these wilds leave recklessly burning. The
destruction thus caused to valuable timber throughout the
island is enormous. Among the ilex were scattered a few
deciduous oaks, contrasting well in their autumnal tints
with their evergreen congeners. We thought the colouring
was not so rich as that of our English oak woods at this
season, being of a paler or more tawny hue, resembling
the maple and sycamore. Precipitous cliffs and insulated
masses of grey rock broke the outline of the forest, and
the charming cyclamen still tufted the edge of the path
with its delicate flowers, nestling among the roots of the
gigantic oaks; between the tall trunks of which glimpses
were occasionally caught of the distant mountain peaks.</p>

<p>We had been ascending, generally at a pretty sharp angle,
from the time we crossed the Bevinco, and had walked
about three hours, when, emerging from the skirts of the
ilex forest, we found ourselves on an elevated ridge connected
with the vast wastes of which the greater part of
the east and north-east of the province of Nebbio is composed.
The surface is bare and stony, with a very scanty
herbage among aromatic plants and bushes of low growth,
consisting principally of the branching cistuses, which,
however they may enliven these barren heaths by their
flowers in the earlier part of the year, increased its parched
and arid appearance now that the leaves hung withered on
their stems.</p>

<p>Yet on these barren solitudes the Corsican shepherd
spends his listless days and watchful nights. He has no
fixed habitation, and never sleeps under a roof, but when
he piles some loose stones against a rock to form a hut.
Roaming over the boundless waste as the necessity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
changing the pasturage of his flock requires, he finds his
best shelter in the skirts of the forest, and his food in the
chestnuts, which he luxuriously roasts in the embers of
his watchfire when he is tired of eating them raw. The
ground was so undulating that at one view we could see
a number of these flocks on the distant hill sides; the
little black sheep in countless numbers dotting the heaths,
and the shepherds, in their brown <i>pelone</i>, either following
them as they browsed in scattered groups, or perched on
strong outline on some rocky pinnacle commanding a wide
area over which their charge was scattered. Their bleating
and the tinkling of the sheep-bells were wafted on the
breeze, and more than once a flock crossed our path, and
we had a nearer view of the wild and uncouth conductor.</p>

<p>My companion sat down to sketch, while I walked on.
This often happened. Indeed, his rambles were often discursive,
so that I lost sight of him for hours together;
once in Sardinia, when there was reason to fear his
having been carried off to the mountains by banditti.
Thus, each had his separate adventures; on the present
occasion I had opened out a new and splendid view, and,
having retraced my steps to lead him to the spot, he
related his.</p>

<p>Intent on his sketch, my friend was startled, on raising
his head, at seeing a wild figure standing at his elbow.
Leaning on a staff, its keen eyes were intently fixed on
him. My friend at once perceived that one of the shepherds
had crept upon him unawares. A year before, when
they all carried arms, there would have been nothing in
his exterior to distinguish him from a bandit, but an ingenuous
countenance and a gentle demeanour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The young shepherd seemed much interested in my
friend's occupation, the object of which, however, he could
not comprehend. His face brightened with pleasure and
surprise on learning that the visitor to his wilds was an
Englishman. The memory of the red-coats, who came to
espouse the cause of Corsican liberty, lingers in Corsican
traditions, and the English are esteemed as their truest
friends. It was something new in the monotonous existence
of the young shepherd to fall in with one of that
race, though he had not the slightest idea where on the
face of the earth they lived; still he was intelligent, inquisitive,
and hospitable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would the stranger accompany him to his hut?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would give me pleasure, but it is growing late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are poor, but we could give you milk and cheese.
You would be welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it. Like you, I love the forest and the mountain,
the shade and the sunshine; but yours must be a
rough life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is our lot, and we are content. We toil not, and
we love our freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like some memorial of having met you, anything
to show that I have talked with an Englishman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My friend rapidly dashed off a slight sketch, a rough
portrait, I think, of his gaunt visitor&mdash;no bad subject for
the pencil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather it had been your own portrait; but I
shall keep it in remembrance of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so they parted; the civilised man to tell his little
story of human feeling and native intelligence, &ldquo;spending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
their sweetness in the desert air,&rdquo;&mdash;the shepherd to relate
his adventure over the watchfire, and perhaps draw forth
from some sexagenarian herdsman his boyish recollections
of the fall of San Fiorenzo and Bastia, and the march of
the English red-coats over the mountains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Chain of the Serra di Tenda.&mdash;A Night at Bigorno.&mdash;A
Hospitable Priest.&mdash;Descent to the Golo.</i></p>


<p>After crossing for some distance an elevated plateau of
this wild country, we came to a boundary wall of rough
boulders, and turned to take a last view of the gulf of San
Fiorenzo and the blue Mediterranean. A heavy gate was
swung open, and, on advancing a few hundred yards, the
scene suddenly changed. We found ourselves on the
brink of a steep descent, with a sea of mountains before
us, branching from the great central chain, and having
innumerable ramifications. This part of the chain is
called the Serra di Tenda; and its highest peak the Monte
Asto, upwards of 5000 feet above the level of the sea,
rose directly in front of our point of view. A single altar-shaped
rock crowned the summit, from which the continuation
of the ridge, right and left, fell away in a singularly
graceful outline, the face of the mountain being precipitous
with escarped cliffs. In other parts of the line,
the summits were sharply serrated. Northward it was
lost in the far distance among clouds and mist, but to
the south-west of Monte Asto a similar, but more blunted
peak towered above all the others. I observed on our maps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that several of the summits in this range have the name
of <i>Monte Rosso</i>; and the centre of the group was indented
by a deep gorge richly wooded, as were other ravines, and
forests hung on some of the mountain sides.</p>

<p>We were struck with the extraordinary warmth of
colouring which pervaded the surface of the vast panorama,
the slopes as well as the precipitous cliffs. They
had the ruddy hue of the inner coating of the ilex
bark, with a piece of which we compared it on the
spot. Again, I felt convinced that this colouring was
not merely an atmospheric effect,&mdash;though doubtless
heightened by the bright sunshine through so pure a
medium as the mountain air&mdash;but that the brilliance
indicated the nature of the formation. Whether it was
granitic or porphyritic, I had no opportunity of examining,
but incline to think it belonged to the latter.</p>

<p>Of the general features of the geological system of
Corsica, an opportunity may occur for taking a short
review. Our present position, embracing so vast an amphitheatre,
was excellent for forming an idea of the physical
structure of this lateral branch from the central range.
Various as were its ramifications, appearing sometimes
grouped in wild confusion, the general unity of the whole
formation, both in colour and form, was very observable,
from the loftiest peak to the offsets of the ridge which
gradually descended to the level of the valleys, just as the
peculiar character of a tree runs through its trunk and
boughs to the minutest twig. Through a gorge to the
northward we traced the pass, the Col di Tenda, the summit
being 4500 feet, through which a road is conducted
to Calvi and l'Isle Rousse, on the western coast; while
immediately under us lay the valley through which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Golo, rising in the central chain, makes its long and
winding course to the <i>littorale</i>, eastward.</p>

<p>The bason, on which we now looked down, was distinguished
by the same features as that of Oletta,&mdash;gentle
hills, wooded slopes and glens, and olive groves, vineyards,
and orchards, in almost equally exuberant richness.
A dozen villages were within view, crowning, as usual, the
tops of the hills, or perched far up the mountain sides.
Of these, Lento and Bigorno are the most considerable,
although Campittello gives its name to the canton. The
strong position of Lento caused it to be often contested
during the wars for Corsican independence, and it was
General Paoli's head-quarters before his last and fatal
battle.</p>

<p>We selected Bigorno, a small village, as our quarters for
the night. The descent to it, about 1000 feet from the
level of the sheep-walks, is extremely rapid; the village
itself being still many hundred feet above the banks of the
Golo, which is seen pouring its white torrent several miles
distant. The approach was interesting, winding through
the evergreen copse and scattered ilex, with the sound of
the church-bell at the <i>Ave-Maria</i> rising from below in the
still air as we descended the mountain side.</p>

<p>Our quarters here were the best we had yet met with.
My companion having staid behind to sketch the village,
and taken shelter from a shower of rain, had been courteously
invited by a gentleman, who passed, to accept the
accommodations of his house for the night, but, in the
meantime, Antoine had conducted me and the baggage to
another house. It belonged to a small proprietor, who was
profuse in his politeness, but, we thought, lacked the really
hospitable feeling we had found in houses of less pretensions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Curiosity or civility brought about us quite a <i>lev&eacute;e</i>
of the better class while we were arranging our toilet.
The supper was execrable, consisting of an <i>olla podrida</i> of
ham, potatoes, and tomatoes stewed in oil and seasoned
with garlick, and the wine and grapes were sour. However,
we had excellent beds. In my room there was a
small collection of books, on a dusty shelf, which I should
not have expected to find in such hands. Among them
were some old works of theological casuistry, Metastasio,
a translation of Voltaire's plays, and a geographical dictionary
in Italian. I learnt that they had belonged to
the proprietor's uncle, a <i>medico</i> at Padua, and were heirlooms
with his property, which our host inherited. The
position of these small proprietors is much to be pitied.
By great penuriousness they contrive to make a poor
living out of a vineyard and garden with a few acres of
land, having neither the spirit nor industry, and perhaps
very little opportunity, to better their condition. There
was evidently some struggle in the mind of our host
between his poverty and gentility&mdash;added to what was
due to the national character for hospitality&mdash;when we
came to proffer some acknowledgment for our reception.
It was just an occasion when, travelling in this way, one
is rather puzzled how to act, but we were relieved from our
difficulty by finding that our offering was received without
much scruple.</p>

<p>Next morning, to my great surprise, for I was too sleepy
to notice it on going to bed, I found a gun standing
ready loaded on one side of the bed, in curious contrast to
the crucifix and holy-water pot on the other,&mdash;succour
close at hand against both spiritual and mortal foes. We
had walked through the country without any alarm, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
concluded that the reign of the rifle and stiletto was ended
in Corsica. But how came the gun to be loaded? was it
from inveterate habit even now that fire-arms were proscribed,
or was Louis Napoleon's decree still eluded?</p>

<p>I shall never forget the view from my chamber windows
as I threw open the long double casement at six o'clock in
the morning. It was my first view of Monte Rotondo,
the loftiest of the Corsican mountains. A long ridge
and its crowning peak were capped with snow. The
range to the eastward was in deep shade, but with a rich
amber hue behind them as the sun rose. I watched
its kindling light as it touched the snowy top of Monte
Rotondo, and spread a purple light over the sides of the
eastern ridge. The night mists had not yet risen from
the valley of the Golo. We hastened to descend towards
it, after the usual small cup of <i>caf&eacute; noir</i> and a piece of
bread. The environs of Bigorno on this side are very
beautiful. Groves of olive with their silvery leaves and
green berries not yet ripened mingled with vines planted
in terraces, the vines festooning and running free, as
one sees them in Italy. Gardens full of peach and fig
trees filled all the hollows&mdash;a charming scene through
which the path wound down the hill. Antoine brought
us fresh figs from one of the gardens&mdash;a relish to the dry
remains of our crust. Before the sun had gained much
elevation, it became exceedingly warm on a southern
exposure; the green lizards darted from crevices in the
vineyard walls, all nature was alive and fresh, and the air
serene, with a most heavenly sky.</p>

<p>All this was very delightful. Nothing can be more so
than this style of travelling in such a country, with a
friend of congenial spirit and taste. My companion was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
very well in this respect; but, as I before observed, his
genius led him to be rather excursive in his rambles,
so that he was sometimes missing when he was most
wanted. Now, we had just started on this very agreeable
morning walk with the prospect of breakfast in due time
at the post-house on the banks of the Golo. But, instead
of our enjoying this together, my friend, by a sudden
impulse, leaped over a vineyard wall, and saying he should
like to take a sketch from that point, desired me to
saunter on, and he would soon overtake me.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/122.jpg" width="500" height="363" alt="NEAR BIGORNO." title="NEAR BIGORNO." />
<p class="caption">NEAR BIGORNO.</p>
</div>

<p>What with a Pisan campanile, a Corsican manse, festooning
vines, a cluster of bamboo canes&mdash;indicative of the
warm south&mdash;and the group of mountains with the truncated
peak in the distance, a very clever sketch was produced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
though not one of my friend's best;&mdash;and I have
great reason to be obliged to him for his sketches, without
which I fear this would be a dull book. At that moment,
indeed, I would have preferred his companionship. However,
bating this feeling and a certain hankering for my
breakfast in the course of a two hours' walk, I trudged on
alone in a very pleasant frame of mind. Nothing could be
more charming than the green slopes round which the path
wound, with occasional glimpses of the Golo beneath,&mdash;its
rapid stream white as the milky Rhone,&mdash;after leaving
behind the orchards and gardens. The rest of the descent
lay through evergreen shrubbery so frequently mentioned,
and a more exquisite piece of <i>m&aacute;quis</i> I had not seen.
Thus sauntering on, sometimes talking with Antoine, a
species of shrub, which I had not much observed before,
attracted my particular attention among the arbutus and
numerous other well-known varieties. It was a bushy
evergreen, of shapely growth, five or six feet high, with
masses of foliage and clusters of bright red berries, having
an aromatic scent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you call this shrub, Antoine?&rdquo; plucking
a branch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Lustinea</i>; the country people express an oil from the
berries for use in their lamps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I perceive it is the <i>Lentiscus</i>.&rdquo; In Africa and
the isle of Scios they make incisions in the stems, from
which the gum mastic is procured. The Turks chew it to
sweeten the breath. It grows also in Provence, Italy, and
Spain.</p>

<p>Presently, I sat down on a bank, casting anxious glances
up the path after my friend, and, basking in the sun,
finished Antoine's basket of figs, which only whetted my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
appetite, while I was endeavouring to indoctrinate Antoine
with the persuasion that our countrymen in general are
neither &ldquo;<i>Calvinistes</i>&rdquo; nor &ldquo;<i>Juives</i>.&rdquo; Antoine, who had
been asking a variety of questions about &ldquo;<i>Inghilterra</i>&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<i>Londra</i>&rdquo; was not better informed on this subject
than a great many foreigners I have met with in Catholic
countries, who, by the former term, class all Protestants
with the Reformed churches of the Continent. I have
often had to inform them, to their manifest surprise, that
we have bishops, priests and deacons, cathedrals, choirs,
deans and canons, vestments, creeds, liturgies and sacraments,
in the English church, and were, in short, very
like themselves, at least in externals. Matters of faith I
did not feel inclined to meddle with.</p>

<p>The discussion ended as we struck the level of the valley
of the Golo, not far from Ponte Nuovo. The heat in this
deep valley became suffocating, and the dusty high road
was an ill exchange for the fresh mountain paths. Here,
then, I made a decided halt, and this being the battle-field
on which, in 1769, the French, after a desperate struggle,
gained a decisive victory over General Paoli and the independent
Corsicans, I had just engaged Antoine in pointing
out the positions of the two armies, and tracing the tide
of battle which, they say, deluged the Golo with blood and
corpses for many miles,&mdash;when my lost companion came
rushing down the hill-path among the rustling evergreens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been waiting long&mdash;excuse me; I have had
a little adventure. That has detained me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; My friend's sketching propensities often
led him into a &ldquo;little adventure,&rdquo; ending in a story which,
I should almost have imagined, he coined for a peace-offering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
but that I had chapter and verse for the main incidents.
There was that story of his being kicked off the
mule, and&mdash;only the evening before&mdash;his <i>rencontre</i> with
the interesting young shepherd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you want your breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have had mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The deuce you have, you are luckier than I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear old fellow, we will push on to Ponte
Nuovo, and you will soon get your's. I really am very
sorry, but I could not help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this is the famous battle-field, you know, and
Antoine was just going to describe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will keep. We will make our <i>reconnaissance</i>
after you have had your breakfast. As we go along, I will
tell you how I got mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The story shall be told as nearly as possible in my
friend's own words.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>&ldquo;After you left me, I sat down to sketch in a little terraced
garden, shaded by fig-trees and vines. My sketch
was nearly finished, and I was thinking how I should
overtake you, when a bright-eyed young maiden came
up, and, with the childlike wonder of a race of people
living far out of the track of sketching tourists, asked me
&#8216;what I was doing.&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8216;Sit down, pretty maiden, and you shall see.&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She obeyed with a <i>na&iuml;ve</i> simplicity, and we soon
prattled away, she telling me that she had never gone
beyond the neighbouring villages, and could not understand
how I should come so far from <i>Inghilterra</i>, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
country she had never heard of, to draw pictures of their
wild mountains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8216;Ah! you cannot comprehend how it is that I love
your wild mountains, and children of nature like yourself.&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8216;Will you come again?&#8217;&mdash;a question put with a
spice of <i>espi&egrave;glerie</i> which, from some other pretty lips,
would be rather flattering. &#8216;Yes, you will come again,
and I shall be grown up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did not seem, I found, quite pleased at being
called &#8216;<i>mon enfant</i>&#8217; by a young stranger, though it was
all very well from her uncle, who, I learnt, was the priest
of the church in my sketch. Presently, away she ran,
blushing and smiling, to tell her uncle that there was a
traveller come from a far-off land who must be hungry,
and who must eat and rest under their roof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good priest received me with much <i>empressement</i>,
having been brought out to meet me by the little Graziella,
as I was following the path to the cottage door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8216;Ah! you are English, you are a Protestant, no
doubt. It matters not; the stranger is welcome under
my humble roof were he a Jew or a Turk. We are all
brothers.&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found the priest well informed on English affairs,
into which, and matters connected with them, we soon
plunged. Meanwhile, Graziella, with the assistance of a
hard-faced but kindly old crone, prepared a repast of fruits,
eggs, coffee; and the priest brought out a bottle of wine,
the produce of his own vineyard, which I have seldom
found equalled. It was all very appetising. I only wished
you were there.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just then, curiously enough, indoctrinating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Antoine, nothing loath, with the priest's sentiment of
universal brotherhood, a simple Gospel truth, which, overlaid
with ecclesiastical systems, never took deep root, and
is sadly out of vogue now-a-days. I imagine we shall
find the Sards far more bigoted than their neighbours
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you were doing your good work, fasting, while
I feasted. It was all tempting, but I was puzzled how to
eat my egg; there were no spoons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not ask for one; you were talking French?
Had you been attempting Italian, you might have stuck
fast. <i>Cucchiaio</i> is one of the most uncouth words in that
beautiful language. Well I remember it being one of the
first I had to pronounce, when, in early days, I got out of
the line of French <i>gar&ccedil;ons</i>: <i>cuc&mdash;cucchi</i>,&mdash;give me our
Anglo-Saxon monosyllables for such things as spoons,
knives, and forks,&mdash;at last I blurted out <i>cucchiaio</i>, in
all its quadrosyllabic fulness. The Rubicon was passed
(by the way, it was on the <i>carte</i> of my route); after that
I stuck at nothing, though for some time it was the
<i>lingua Toscana&mdash;in bocca&mdash;Inglese</i>.&mdash;But how did you
manage your egg?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it is good manners, you know, to do at Rome
as others do, so I watched the priest. He removed the
top, as we do, and then very nicely sipped the contents of
the shell, which&mdash;charming Graziella! excellent <i>duenna!</i>&mdash;were
done to a turn, just creamy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I perceive it was suction, a primitive idea, when
spoons were not. Now I understand the old proverb about
not teaching our venerable progenitors &#8216;to suck eggs.&#8217;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old fellow, cease your banter, or I shall never get to
the end of my story. As to the eggs, I did not manage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
mine as cleverly as the priest did his. I made a mess of
it, bestowing good part of the yolk on my moustache, much
to Graziella's amusement. I perceived she could hardly
refrain from tittering. But she was soon sobered,&mdash;the
conversation turning on the last days of Corsica&mdash;and
tears came in her eyes. Alas! the ruthless spirit of <i>vendetta</i>
in this wild country had cost her the lives of her
father and brothers; and, her mother being dead, she was
left an orphan under the care of the good priest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8216;Uncle, persuade him to stay, if only for another
hour. I should like to hear more of those countries where
there is no <i>vendetta</i>; where they plough and reap and
dwell in safety; where fathers and brothers are not compelled
to flee from their villages to the wild <i>m&aacute;quis</i> and
the mountain crags.&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8216;My pretty child, I cannot stay now. Perhaps some
day I may return.&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8216;<i>Addio!</i> then. <i>Evviva! Evviva!</i> In two years I
shall be grown up, and uncle will no longer call me child,
and you shall tell me more of lands I shall never see. But
ah! I know it will never be. <i>Bon voyage!</i> Forget not
the priest's home among the mountains of Corsica.&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not forget it. How often one says hopefully
&#8216;I will come back,&#8217; when it would be idle ever to expect
it; and yet I would wish to see once more the little girl
who said, &#8216;Come, if it is but for an hour!&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rushed down the mountain side, and found you
scorched with a burning sun, thirsty, breakfastless,&mdash;the
very image of the knight of the woeful countenance,&mdash;I
all joy and fun with my morning's adventure, you perplexed,
out of patience, hungry, and tired. I cannot help
laughing at the contrast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XIII" id="CHAP_XIII"></a>CHAP. XIII.</h2>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Ponte Nuovo.&mdash;The Battle-field.&mdash;Antoine's Story.</i></p>


<p>Half an hour's walk along the high-road brought us to
the solitary building of which we were in search. Uniting
the character of an <i>albergo</i> and a fortified post, of which
there are several scattered throughout the island on commanding
spots, the loop-holed walls, with projecting angles
for a cross-fire, and the barrack round a court within, still
occupied by a small party of <i>gendarmes</i>, were striking
mementos of the state of insecurity in Corsica, and what
travelling was at no very distant period. Shut in by the
mountains, the air of the valley is close and stifling,
disease marked the countenances of the few inmates, and
the barrack-room into which we climbed, with its benches
and tables, were all miserably dirty. The promise of a
dish of fresh trout from the Golo was a redeeming feature
in the aspect of affairs to one who had waited long, and
walked far, without his breakfast. But the dish reeked as
if the Golo ran oil, and the fish were still floating in the
unctuous stream, spite of my injunctions to the weird
priestess of the mysteries of the cave beneath&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Senza
olio, senza olio</i>,&rdquo; reversing the phrase in the Baron de
Grimm's story of the Frenchman, who, having sacrificed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
his own <i>go&ucirc;t</i> to his guest's <i>penchant</i> for asparagus <i>au
naturel</i>, on his friend's falling down in a swoon, rushed to
the top of the staircase, shouting to his cook, &ldquo;<i>Tout &agrave;
l'huile, tout &agrave; l'huile</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We stood on the bridge of Ponte Nuovo, just beneath
the post, the scene of the last struggle for Corsican independence;
and there Antoine pointed out the details. The
Corsicans, under Pascal Paoli, having occupied the strong
position in the Nebbio through which we had been
rambling for the last few days, the Count de Vaux, the
French generalissimo, concentrated his forces, amounting
to forty-five battalions, four regiments of cavalry, and a
powerful artillery, determined to crush Paoli's brave but
ill-organised militia, and finish the war by a single blow.
The French commenced the attack on the 3rd of May,
1769. For two days it was an affair of outposts, but, on
the 3rd, De Vaux pressed Paoli with such vigour in his
fortified camp at Murato, that the Corsican general was
forced to retire beyond the Golo. He established himself
in the <i>pieve</i> of Rostino, a few miles above the bridge,
leaving orders for Gaffori to hold the strong heights of
Lento, while Grimaldi was to defend Canavaggia,&mdash;two
points by which the French might penetrate into the
interior. Bribed by French gold, Grimaldi&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Ah! il
traditore!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Antoine,&mdash;and Gaffori, unmindful
of his honourable name, offered no resistance to the
advance of the French.</p>

<p>On the 9th of May, the militia left by Paoli to defend
the passes into the valley, finding themselves unsupported,
abandoned their posts and fled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down the pass we descended this morning from
Bigorno,&rdquo; said Antoine, &ldquo;through those other gorges you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
see in the mountains, our people poured in wild confusion,
closely pursued by the enemy. They thronged to the
bridge. It was held by a company of Prussians, who had
passed from the Genoese to the Corsican service; and a
thousand Corsican militia lined the river bank. If the
French carried the bridge, all was lost. The Prussians
were the only regular troops in Paoli's army. They stood
firm in their discipline. The fugitives threw themselves
upon them, charged with the bayonet by the French in
the rear. The Prussians had to hold their position against
friends and foes, indiscriminately, after a vain attempt to
rally the flying Corsicans. Unfortunately they fired into
the mass. A cry of &#8216;Treachery!&#8217; was raised, the panic
became general, disorder spread throughout the ranks, the
enemy profited by it to secure their victory; the rout
was complete, and the Corsicans scattered themselves
among the mountains and forests. The Golo was red
with blood, and the corpses of my countrymen, mingled
with their enemies, floated in its current for many miles.
It was a day of woe, a fatal day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The feeling of nationality still lingers in Corsica, though
without an object, without a hope. Men such as Antoine,
the mountaineers, the shepherds,&mdash;all true-hearted Corsicans
treasure up the traditions of former times, and, with
the scene before his eyes, Antoine traced the action of
Ponte Nuovo with as lively an enthusiasm, as deep an
interest, as if it had been an affair of yesterday, in which
he had borne a part.</p>

<p>But the vision passed away. Antoine had pressing
cares of immediate interest, to which he now gave vent.
Here we were to part; we had an opportunity of forwarding
our baggage to Corte by the <i>voiture</i> which daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
passes Ponte Nuovo, and there was no further need of the
services of Antoine and his mule. He would gladly have
followed our steps to the extremity of Corsica&mdash;to the end
of the world, and we were sorry to part from him. Short
as our acquaintance was, he had become attached to us.
Our rambles had brought us into close intimacy, and
suited his taste.</p>

<p>We sat down on the river bank, and he unbosomed his
mind more freely than he had yet done. We learnt, on
our first acquaintance, that he had left his country and
sailed to foreign parts. What forced him to emigrate had
been inferred from a fearful disclosure to which no reference
had been since made. Now, on the eve of parting,
he told us all his story, and opened out his hopes for the
future. For reasons into which we did not inquire, there
seemed to be no apprehensions as to his personal safety;
but, lamenting the want of means and opportunity for
bettering his condition at home, his thoughts again
reverted to emigration. It was the best thing he could
do; and, reminding him of the success of many of his
neighbours from Capo Corso, who sought their fortunes
in South America, we exhorted him not to indulge the
indolence natural to his countrymen, but apply himself
manfully to an enterprise for which he had many qualifications,
and heartily wished him success.</p>

<p>The point on which his story turned was, as I suspected,
a tale of love, jealousy, revenge. He related the catastrophe
with more than usual feeling, but without any
seeming remorse. He was justified by the Corsican code
of honour. The details, though simple, might be worked
up into one of those romantic and sentimental tales for
which Corsican life supplies abundant materials. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
neither is that my <i>r&ocirc;le</i>, nor am I willing to betray
Antoine's confidence. My readers shall have, instead, a
similar tale&mdash;of which, as it happens, a namesake of
Antoine is the hero&mdash;developing the same powerful
passions. It is not one of the stock stories borrowed from
books which one finds repeated in writers on Corsica, but,
I believe, from the source from which I derived it, an
original as well as authentic tale. The scene lies at a
village in the mountains, not far from Ponte Nuovo, our
present halting-place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_XIV" id="CHAP_XIV"></a>CHAP. XIV.</h2>

<p class="chap">FILIAL DUTY, LOVE, AND REVENGE: A CORSICAN TALE.</p>


<p>On a fine spring morning, some thirty years ago, there
was an unusual stir in a <i>paese</i> standing near the high-road
between Bastia and Ajaccio. The village, like most others
in Corsica, clustered round a hill-top, and stood on the
skirts of a deep forest, with which the eye linked it
through intervening groves of spreading chestnut and
other fruit-trees. It was Sunday; and, after mass, the
whole population flocked to the market-place, a large open
area in front of the <i>Mairie</i>, to witness one of those trials
of skill in shooting at a mark, formerly common in Corsica
as well as in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Above the roof of the <i>Mairie</i> sprung a grim tower,
serving at once for a prison, in which criminals were confined,
and for the barracks of the <i>gendarmerie</i> stationed in
that wild district. On the present occasion the target was
set up at the foot of this tower, and all the young men of
the village were, in turn, making a trial of skill with their
long guns, while the old peasants stood near giving advice,
and the village girls, ranged in <i>costume de f&ecirc;te</i> round the
palisades inclosing the place, rewarded the most successful
of the competitors with smiles and glances of encouragement.</p>

<p>The contest had lasted for some time, and many shots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
were fired without the mark&mdash;fixed at the distance of
about 300 paces&mdash;having been hit, when a young man,
armed with a short Tyrolese rifle, came up to the barrier.
He was dressed after the fashion of his fathers, but with
great neatness. Short breeches of green velvet descended
to the knees, and the calves of his legs were encased in
deer-skin gaiters fastened by metal buttons. A broad belt
of red leather girded his loins. It concealed a small pouch
of cartridges, but the hilt of a strong dagger peeped from
underneath the belt. His open shirt exposed to view a
manly breast. He wore a sort of jacket of the same stuff
as the breeches, but faced with crimson, and garnished,
after the Spanish fashion, with a number of small silver
studs. A high-crowned hat of black felt was cocked jantily
on one side of his head, and a medallion of the <i>Madre dei
Dolori</i> stuck in the band, completed the picturesque costume
of the Corsican peasant.</p>

<p>The young man, on his arrival, received a cordial welcome
from all the competitors for the honours of the day,
and, among the village maidens, many a bright eye beamed
with a tender but modest delight on his manly form,
shown to advantage in the national costume. Still he
gave no sign of an intention to take any part in the sport
for which they were assembled.</p>

<p>In consequence, after a short interval, during which the
firing had ceased, an old villager thus addressed him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it, Antonio, that you, the best marksman in
the village, have joined us so late? The sport flags; let
us have one of your true, unerring shots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, father Joachimo, I am in no humour
to-day to partake in the gaiety of my friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pressed, however, by repeated entreaties, the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
man at last yielded, and, advancing to the barrier, and
unloosing his rifle from the slings, took a cartridge from
his pouch, and proceeded to charge his piece with much
deliberation. While doing this, his eyes were fixed on a
crevice in the tower, from which was hanging a little iron
cage containing the mouldering remains of a human skull.
At this spectacle his countenance changed from its usual
ruddy hue to a mortal paleness, and tears were seen to
fill his eyes.</p>

<p>Having charged his rifle, Antonio took his position in
the attitude of firing; but, it was remarked, that in taking
aim, he levelled the barrel higher than the mark at the
foot of the tower. A moment of solemn silence was followed
by a flash, a sharp crack,&mdash;and the whizzing bullet
struck the skull in the cage. The shock brought both to
the ground, and, at the same instant, the young man,
quick as thought, leaped over the palisades, and, gathering
up the fragments of skull, quickly disappeared. The spectators
of this strange scene asked each other what it
meant; and, in the midst of the hubbub, Joachimo, the old
peasant who had invited Antonio to try his skill in the feat
of arms, raised his voice to satisfy their curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My children,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Corsican blood has not degenerated;
of this you have witnessed a striking proof in the
act of Antonio. The skull, which hung on the tower wall,
was that of a man unjustly condemned to death, of a man
whose only crime was, his having taken vengeance with
his own hand for the insult offered his wife by an inhabitant
of the continent. The skull was that of Antonio's father;
and a son, a true Corsican, could not submit to having his
father's remains dishonoured. This day he has wiped out
the ignominy,&mdash;henceforth Antonio is an outlaw, proscribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
by the men of law, by the French; but we Corsicans
shall ever esteem him a man of honour and of
courage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd then dispersed, full of admiration for the
brave Antonio, and the event of the morning became the
theme of the evening's conversation in all the families of
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Antonio, having gained the forest, rapidly
threaded its tangled paths for nearly an hour. He then
stopped in one of its deepest recesses, and, having keenly
reconnoitred every avenue of approach, threw himself
weary at the foot of a tree, and opening the handkerchief
in which he had wrapped his father's skull, gave vent to a
flood of tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my father!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my father! why could I
not take vengeance on the authors of your death? why
could I not avenge myself on the descendants of the base
Frenchman who insulted my mother? why could I not
wash out, in their blood, the shame that has fallen on our
family, and embittered our existence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the thought of vengeance the eyes of the young
islander flashed fire, his tears dried up, and that heart, just
now so open to tender emotions, would have prompted him
to plunge his dagger in the bosom of those who were the
cause of his misery.</p>

<p>Again, the fit changed; for, in the midst of this storm of
passion, a name quivered on his lips, like the star seen in
the drifting clouds when the tempest is raging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madal&eacute;na!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;all is now finished between
us;&mdash;Antonio is a bandit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, exercising a strong power over himself, he passed
his hand over his forehead, as if to drive evil thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
from his brain, and, unsheathing his strong dagger, dug a
hole at the foot of the oak, in which he deposited his
precious burthen. A cross, carved by his dagger on the
trunk of the tree, served for a memorial of his father's
fate:&mdash;ah! what thoughts, what sorrows, did that cross
recall to his mind!&mdash;and, after a short prayer, he hastened
from the spot which had witnessed his last act of filial duty.</p>

<p>Wretched Antonio! a solitary outcast, abandoned by all,
what refuge was left for you but the forest and the <i>m&aacute;quis</i>?&mdash;what
protector, but your good rifle&mdash;what hope, but in
the grave! Nay, another passion, another image, was
deeply graven on his heart! Love&mdash;that divine passion,
which ennobles a man, which gives him courage, which fills
him with heroism&mdash;afforded him strength to survive so
many calamities.</p>

<p>Some days after these occurrences, a young maiden crept
stealthily at early dawn from among the houses in the
village of Allari, fifteen leagues distant from Bastia, and
gained unseen the <i>purlieus</i> of the neighbouring wood
before any of the villagers were abroad. The maiden's
age was about eighteen years; her step was light, her
form slender and graceful; health sparkled in her dark
eyes; her enterprise lent a ruddier hue to her olive skin,
and a profusion of raven-black tresses floated on her
shoulders, as she brushed through the evergreen shrubbery
on the verge of the wood, where, concealed in the
hollow of an aged chestnut tree, a young man had been
waiting her arrival for upwards of an hour. This young
man was Antonio, the maiden Madal&eacute;na.</p>

<p>On perceiving her approach, Antonio hastened to quit
his hiding place, and came to meet her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How kind you are, Madal&eacute;na,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;you, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
rich, so young, so beautiful&mdash;to expose yourself for me to
the cold morning air; to brave, perhaps, the anger of your
parents, for one of whom you know so little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true that you told me once that you loved me;
and love knows no obstacles, and makes nothing of distances.
But I must not abuse your confidence. Madal&eacute;na,
my bosom labours with a secret which I have too
long preserved. I have done wrong; I have deceived
you. I feared, I dreaded, that in disclosing it to you, I
should forfeit your love, your esteem; that you would
avoid me as the world does a man to whom society gives
an ill name. Yes, Madal&eacute;na, you have to learn&mdash;Madal&eacute;na,
hitherto I have not had the courage to tell it to you&mdash;learn
that I am a....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Antonio shrunk from giving utterance to a word which
would probably crush all his hopes, and break the last tie
which held him to the world. So, changing his purpose,
he continued in an altered tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I embitter the moments which ought to
be given to love? Is it not true, Madal&eacute;na, that you
love me for myself? Ah! tell me that you love me, for
there is great need that I should hear it from your own
lips, and without this love I should be wretched indeed.
Tell me that you do not want to know my past; that you
love me because our hearts understand each other; because
our two souls, breathed into us by the Author of our
existence, were formed to love each other for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madal&eacute;na, perceiving the feebleness of her lover, took
his hand, and fixing on him an eager gaze, made him sit
by her side. On touching that much-loved hand, the
young man started, and a sudden shivering ran through
his veins. The maiden perceived it, and a gleam of satisfaction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and almost coquetry, sparkled in her eyes. Poor
woman's heart! Even in the most solemn moments she
is always a coquette. Such is her nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Antonio,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you vow that you love me; why
then hesitate to confide to me your secrets, your sorrows?
Am I not some day to be your wife? I have sworn it
before God and my mother, and I shall be. Why then
do you defer telling me the cause of your long sufferings.
I have long perceived that your heart is oppressed by
some secret thought. Can it be that you are in love with
another, Antonio? Tell me if it is so; you shall have
my forgiveness, and I will say to the woman who is the
choice of your heart, &#8216;Love him, for he is worthy of it!&#8217;
And if it were required that I should shed my blood for
your happiness, I would not hesitate a single moment to
make the sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no, Madal&eacute;na, think not so! Do you suppose
me capable of betraying you, of casting you off? I, who
love you with a perfect love, a love as pure as that which
makes the bliss of angels,&mdash;with which a child loves its
mother? For one fond look from you I would brave the
fury of men&mdash;of men and the elements. Drive this suspicion
from your heart, and God grant that, when you
have learnt my secret, you may continue to entertain the
same sentiments towards me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Antonio drew near to the maiden, and,
hiding his face in her hands, whispered in her ear:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madal&eacute;na, Madal&eacute;na, I am&mdash;a bandit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young girl shrieked with terror, and fainted in his
arms. Antonio laid her on the grass, and, having sprinkled
her face with the fresh morning dew, knelt by her side.
Presently, Madal&eacute;na opened her eyes, and seeing Antonio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
kneeling, and still holding her hand, roused herself with
a sudden effort, and, casting on him a look of mingled
horror and scorn, said to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave me, Antonio, you make me shudder, your hands
are stained with the blood of the innocent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Antonio, crazed with love, crawled to her feet and
wept; but having, after much difficulty, prevailed with her
to hear him, he related to her the story of the skull, the
only crime for which he was a bandit. After this explanation,
Madal&eacute;na seemed to be reassured, and her lover
awaited his final sentence from her lips in breathless suspense.
The maiden's heart was touched by his tale, and
observing him with an air of less severity, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied that you speak the truth; but I have a
mother and father, and I think, that after this disclosure,
I could never become your wife without abandoning them
for ever. At this moment I am too much agitated to
come to any decision; return to morrow, and you shall
know my final resolve. Meanwhile, rest assured that I
pity and love you still, considering you more unfortunate
than guilty, and that I will either be your wife, or the
wife of no other man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus saying, she hastened from the spot.</p>

<p>Antonio saw her depart without having the courage to
address to her another word. That man so brave, who
knew no fear, recoiled from no danger, wept like a child.
A sad presentiment told him that it was his last meeting
with Madal&eacute;na, though her concluding promise tended in
some degree to reassure him.</p>

<p>Madal&eacute;na shut herself up in her chamber and shed
floods of tears&mdash;tears not of love, but of shame. For
her&mdash;the daughter of a wealthy citizen of Ajaccio, brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
up in the manners, and tinctured with the prejudices of
the continent, who knew nothing of the world but its
empty phantoms, nor of love but its coquetry&mdash;it was
disgrace to love and be loved by the son of a bandit, by
one who was himself a bandit.</p>

<p>From that day Madal&eacute;na never returned to the wood.
Every morning the unhappy Antonio retraced his steps to
the place of meeting, but only to have his hopes crushed.
He was forgotten, perhaps scorned. Love, the sentiment
of the heart, had yielded to the influence of the frivolous
ideas of society, the conventional maxims of the world.
This young maiden had not the courage to affirm in the
face of all, &ldquo;I love Antonio, because he is not guilty of
any crime; I love him because he has avenged his father,
because he is a true son of Corsica.&rdquo; But she had not the
spirit, the strength of mind, to say this. The Corsican
blood had degenerated in her veins, or she would have
felt that it was no crime for Antonio to achieve the removal
from public view of the horrid spectacle which was
a continual witness of shame and ignominy,&mdash;exposed by
a relic of barbarism, called law, to the gaze and scorn of
all who passed along the streets,&mdash;that no stain rested
on the memory of Antonio's father, because, as a husband
and a father, he had avenged the honour of his wife and
his children.</p>

<p>A year after these events, the whole population of the
village of Allari was again astir. Its only bell clanged
incessantly, and gay troops of both sexes, in holiday dress,
flocked through the streets in the direction of the <i>Mairie</i>.
It was a bright morning of the month of April; joy
floated in the air, and pleasure sparkled in every eye.
Presently, a nuptial procession was formed, and took its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
way towards the church. All eyes rested on the bride
and bridegroom; they did not wear the Corsican dress,
but adopted French fashions. Everything about them
betokened wealth, and an affectation of continental manners.</p>

<p>As soon as the procession had entered the church, the
streets became deserted; but a young man, who from an
early hour had concealed himself in the cemetery, now
glided round the church, casting anxious glances on every
side, as if apprehensive of being discovered. His clothes,
torn to tatters, his unshorn beard and long, dishevelled,
hair, blood-shot eyes, and haggard countenance, betokened
the extremity of anguish and want. His feet were naked,
and he carried in his hand a short rifle.</p>

<p>Arrived at the church door, and having glanced within,
he paused for a moment, leaning against the pillar. The
nuptial ceremony had reached the point where the minister
of God, after pronouncing the mystic words, demands of
the betrothed their assent to the marriage union; when,
just as the bride was in the act of uttering the word
which binds for ever the destinies of both, the barrel of
the rifle, held by the man stationed at the door, was levelled,
and the <i>fianc&eacute;e</i> fell, pierced in the breast with a mortal
wound. The man, who fired, threw down his rifle, and,
dashing into the church like one demented, took the dying
woman in his arms, and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madal&eacute;na, you broke your troth to me; you rendered
me desperate; we die together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, unsheathing his dagger, he plunged it several times
into his breast, falling on the dying woman, who opened
her eyes, and, recognising her lover, expired with the
name of &ldquo;Antonio&rdquo; on her lips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Her betrothed was conveyed away by his relations, and
the recollection of this terrible scene disturbed for a long
while the tranquillity of the village. The church in which
it took place was, after the catastrophe, stripped of all its
sacred ornaments, and left to decay. Its ruins may still
be seen on a point of rising ground, and, if an inquiring
traveller takes a turn behind the church, he will find in
the cemetery, on the spot where Antonio was concealed, a
grave-stone inscribed with the names of Madal&eacute;na and
Antonio, surmounted by a rude representation of a rifle
and a dagger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Morosaglia, Seat of the Paolis.&mdash;Higher Valley of the Golo.&mdash;Orography
of Corsica.&mdash;Its Geology</i>.</p>


<p>On crossing to the right bank of the Golo at <i>Ponte Nuovo</i>,
we enter the canton of Morosaglia, the former <i>pi&egrave;ve</i> of Rostino,
and the home of the Paoli family. The canton takes
its present name from a Franciscan convent, still standing,
and part of it used as an elementary school, founded by
the will of Pascal Paoli.</p>

<p>It is about two hours' walk from Ponte Nuovo to the
hamlet in which the Paolis were born. The house is one
of those gaunt, misshapen, rude structures, built of rough
stones, and blackened by age, which one sees everywhere
in the mountain villages; without even glass to the windows.
Standing on the craggy summit of an insulated rock, the
access to it is by a rough wooden staircase. Here Pascal
Paoli resided, as a simple citizen, after the manner of his
fathers, polished as his manners were, and highly as he
was accomplished, after he had attained to almost sovereign
power. The rooms are so small that he transacted
public business in the neighbouring convent of Morosaglia.</p>

<p>There also his brother, Clemente Paoli, had a cell to
which he often retired. His was a singular character. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
a saturnine cast of disposition, he seldom spoke to those
by whom he was surrounded; a great part of his time was
spent in religious observances, and in the practice of the
most rigid austerities. In short, he was the monk when
at home, and the most intrepid warrior when engaged
with the enemy of his country. The sanctity of his
private life procured him singular veneration, and his
presence in battle produced a wonderful effect on the
patriots. Even when pulling the trigger to destroy his
enemy, he is said to have prayed for the soul of his falling
antagonist.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> After the fatal field of Ponte Nuovo, declining
to follow his brother to England, he spent twenty years in
prayer and penance in the Benedictine Abbey of Vallombrosa,
that shady and sequestered retreat in the heart of
the Apennines, returning to his native Corsica only to
die. Such was Clemente Paoli. Of his brother Pasquale,
a fitting place for some more extended notice will be found
at Corte, the seat of his island throne.</p>

<p>The country on the right bank of the river is rugged;
rude <i>pa&eacute;se</i> crown the heights, and the hollows are shrouded
in magnificent chestnut woods. The mountains seen from
beyond Bigorno shut in the valley of the Golo so closely
in some places, that it is a mere defile giving passage to
the river and the road. The river is a torrent, and the
valley is ascended at a sharp angle. At <i>Ponte &agrave; la Leccia</i>,
we recrossed to the left bank of the river; the valley
expanded, and there was much cultivated land, though
the soil was poor. Rounded hills in the foreground were
backed by a serrated range of mountains, Monte Rotondo
being just visible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Approaching now, through the high valleys, the central
region of the mountain system of Corsica, this may be a
proper place for a brief survey of the main features in its
orography and geological structure. We have hitherto
spoken of a central chain and its ramifications in a loose
manner; but it would be desirable to convey more precise
ideas of the structure of this mountain island; and, as the
system happens to be very simple and intelligible, it
affords an example, on a small scale, which may give the
unscientific reader a general idea of the nature of grander
operations. Having traversed the island from north to
south, and from east to west, not without an eye to its
general structure and composition, though making no
pretensions to exact scientific knowledge, I may be able to
furnish a not unfaithful digest of the observations of the
foreign geologists <i>Elie de Beaumont</i>, <i>Raynaud</i>, <i>Gueymard</i>
and others, as I find them quoted in Marmocchi's work.</p>


<p class="title">OROGRAPHY OF CORSICA.</p>

<p>At first sight, Corsica presents the aspect of a chaos of
mountains piled one on another, with their escarped sides
rising from the sea to great elevations; but on a closer
examination, and with the assistance of an accurate map,
it is soon perceived that these mountains, apparently
heaped up in wild confusion, are distinctly arranged in
three principal directions,&mdash;from north-east to south-west,
from north-west to south-east, and from north to south.</p>

<p>The point which forms the main link of the whole
system lies high, near the snowy sources of the Golo. This
elevated part of the island, with the districts immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
surrounding it,&mdash;an Alpine and forest region in which
the principal rivers and streams take their rise,&mdash;this
region so sublime in its vast solitudes, so poetic, so
savagely wild, so picturesque,&mdash;may be called the Switzerland
of Corsica.</p>

<p>From this central link two great chains, forming, so to
speak, the backbone of the island, diverge in opposite
directions. One section, tending to the south-east, traverses
the centre of the island, where the Monte Rotondo
and Monte d'Oro lift to the skies their ever snowy
peaks, and terminates at the Monte Incudine. This high
chain throws out its longest branches to the south-west,
each of them forming at its extremity a lofty promontory
washed by the Mediterranean, and the successive ridges
inclosing delightful and fertile valleys.</p>

<p>The other section of the central chain describes a curved
line to the north-north-east, as far as Monte Grosso; and,
over the Bevinco, links itself with the system of Capo
Corso by the offsets of Monte Antonio and San Leonardo,
by which latter <i>col</i> we crossed the ridge on the evening of
our landing in Corsica. The spurs from this second chain
take, in general, a north-west direction towards the sea.
Less considerable than those connected with the first, they
inclose narrower valleys, and form promontories less
<i>saillants</i>, and of inferior elevation on the western coast.</p>

<p>The mountains of Capo Corso, extending in a chain
nearly north and south, at a short distance from the east
coast, form the third orographic division of the island;
this chain, as observed in a former chapter, being cut by
deep valleys of short extent, the channels of torrents discharging
themselves into the Tuscan Sea.</p>

<p>Between this long chain, extending from Monte Antonio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to Monte Incudine, and the tortuous ranges detached
obliquely from it, lies a central area equal in surface to a
fifth part of the whole island of which it forms the heart&mdash;the
interior. The general inclination of this area, with
the openings of the valleys, tends to the east. It does not
form one single bason, but, intersected as it is in various
directions by secondary ranges, and by mountains linking
the principal chain, its <i>contour</i> is composed of a series of
deep and generally narrow valleys, rising one above the
other. The grandest as well as the most elevated of these
basons is that of the <i>Niolo</i>, the citadel of Corsica.</p>

<p>These lofty mountain chains, with the numerous ramifications
detached from them, and extending in all directions,
render the communications between one place and
another, between the coasts on opposite sides of the island,
extremely difficult. The passage from the western to the
eastern shore can only be effected by climbing to great
elevations, through long and narrow gorges, through deep
ravines of savage aspect, and covered with dense forests.
The Corsicans give a lively idea of some of these toilsome
paths by calling them <i>scale</i>,&mdash;ladders, staircases;&mdash;and
such, indeed, they are, the steps, often prolonged for miles,
being partly the work of Nature, partly cut in the rock by
the hand of man.</p>


<p class="title">GEOLOGY OF CORSICA.</p>

<p>In the present state of science there can be no difficulty
in ascribing the origin of the three great lines of the
Corsican mountains, to which all the others are subordinate,
to three vast upheavings of the soil in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
they take. The order of these elevations above the surface
of the ancient sea thrice repeated in the long series
of past ages, giving the first existence to the island, and
by successive conglomerations shaping its present bold
and irregular profile, may be also distinctly traced.</p>

<p>The masses first raised to the surface of the sea, supposed
to be of igneous origin, lifted by the intense action
of fire or subterranean heat from vast depths, and called
by English geologists &ldquo;Plutonic rocks,&rdquo; as differing from
&ldquo;Volcanic,&rdquo;&mdash;these masses constitute nearly the whole
south-western coast of Corsica, one half of the whole
island.</p>

<p>If an ideal line be drawn diagonally from a point so far
north-west as Cape <i>Revellata</i>, near Calvi, to the point of
<i>Araso</i>, far down the south-east coast near Porto Vecchio,
this primary eruption may be traced in the several ranges,
perpendicular to the ideal line and parallel with each
other, which descending to the sea in the direction of from
north-east to south-west, terminate in the principal promontories
on the western coast, and form the numerous
valleys which appear in succession from the Straits of
Bonifacio to the Gulf of Porto.</p>

<p>Thus at the earliest epoch the principal axis of the
island had its direction from the north-west to the south-east.
The Capo Corso of those times lifted its head above
the Sea of Calvi, and who can say how far the island
extended at the opposite extremity? All we know is, that
the group of rocky islets called the <i>Isole Cerbicale</i>, south-west
of Porto Vecchio, with the <i>Isola du Cavallo</i>, and that
<i>Di Lavazzi</i> off the coast at Bonifacio; and again, the islets
<i>Die Razzoli</i> and <i>Budelli</i> on the opposite side of the
Straits, with the larger islands of <i>La Madal&eacute;na</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
<i>Caprera</i>, all of a similar formation with the primary
Corsican range,&mdash;like detached fragments of some vast
ruined structure,&mdash;appear to form the links of a chain
which united Corsica with the mountain system of the
north-eastern portion of the island of Sardinia.</p>

<p>These primitive masses are almost entirely granitic; and
thus, at the epoch of its first emergence from the waters
of the Mediterranean, no spark of animal or vegetable life
existed in the new island.</p>

<p>So also one half of the masses raised by the <i>second</i>
upheaval, having the same general direction, are granitic.
But, as we advance towards the north-east, the granites
insensibly resolve themselves into <i>ophiolitic</i> rocks,&mdash;a
name given by French geologists to certain volcanic eruptions
of the cretaceous era,&mdash;which are also found in the
Morea.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> There are but few traces remaining of this
second upheaval, which evidently laid in ruins great part
of the northern extremity of the former one, cutting it at
right angles to the east of the Gulf of Porto. This line,
ranging from the south-west to the north-east into the
heart of the <i>Nebbio</i>, is broken up and destroyed through
nearly its whole length.</p>

<p>The disorder and ruin of these several points of the
original system, and the almost total destruction of its
northern part, were undoubtedly caused by the <i>third</i> and
last upheaval which gave the island the form it presents
at the present day. Its direction was from north to
south, and so long as the mass then raised did not come in
contact with the land created by former upheavals, it preserved
its regular line, as we find in the mountain-chain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of Capo Corso. But when, on emerging above the surface
of the sea, this mass had to overcome at its southern
extremity the resistance of the primary rocks upheaved
long before, and now become hard and consolidated,&mdash;in
that terrible shock, on the one hand, it changed, crushed,
or ruined all that obstructed its progress, while, on the
other, it varied its own direction and was itself broken up
in many places, as appears from the openings of the valleys
communicating from the interior with the plains of the
eastern littoral and giving a passage to the torrents which
fall into the sea on this coast,&mdash;the Bevinco, the Golo, the
Tavignano, the Fiumorbo.</p>

<p>The fundamental rocks brought up by this third and
last upheaval are ophiolitic, and metamorphic, or primary,
limestone, overlaid in some places by secondary formations.
&ldquo;The granites on the west, as well as the south,
of the island include some beds of <i>gneiss</i> and <i>schistes</i> at
their extremities.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Gueymard</i>). Almost everywhere the
granite is covered&mdash;an evident proof that the epoch of its
eruption preceded that when the deposits were formed in
the depths of the sea, and deposited in horizontal strata
on the crystalline masses of the granite.</p>

<p>Masses of euritic and porphyritic rocks intersect the
granites, and a distinct formation of porphyries crowns
Monte Cinto, Vagliorba, and Pertusato, the highest summits
of the <i>Niolo</i>, covering the granite. These porphyries
are pierced by greenstone two or three feet thick, and the
granites are intersected by numerous veins of amphibolite
(hornblende) and greenstone, generally running from east
to west.</p>

<p>Transition rocks, as they are called, occupy the whole
of Capo Corso and the east of the island. They consist of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
talcose-schiste, bluish-grey limestone, talc in beds, serpentine,
black marble similar to the oldest in the Alps, quartz,
feldspar, and porphyries.</p>

<p>The tertiary strata are only found at certain points in
isolated fragments. One of these occupies the bottom of
the Gulf of San Fiorenzo and part of its eastern shore.
There the beds rest with a strong inclination against the
lower declivities of the chain of Capo Corso, rising from
upwards of 600 to 900 feet above the level of the Mediterranean,&mdash;a
distinct proof that their formation at
the bottom of the sea was anterior to the upheaval of that
chain, and of the whole system of mountains having their
direction north and south.</p>

<p>In the deep escarped valleys between San Fiorenzo and
the tower of <i>Farinole</i>, the tertiary deposits are seen in
successive layers forming beds which in some places are
in the aggregate from 400 to 500 feet thick, and the calcareous
beds contain great quantities of fossil remains of
marine animals of low organisation, such as sea-urchins,
pectens, and other shells; forming a compact mass, of
which the greater part of the formation consists. The
singular phenomenon of the presence of rounded boulders
of euritic porphyry, resembling that of the <i>Niolo</i>, embedded
in these strata, proves to a certainty that at an
epoch anterior to the upheaval of the system running
north and south, and of the mountains of <i>La Tenda</i>
depending on it, the high valleys of the present bason of
the Golo, and especially that of the Golo, were prolonged
to the sea.</p>

<p>A <i>second</i> tertiary deposit exists near <i>Volpajola</i>, on the
left bank of the Golo, nearly eight miles from the eastern
coast. The beds lying horizontally are full of shells.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>We find a third fragment of a tertiary formation on the
part of the <i>littorale</i> stretching from the mouth of the
Alistro to that of the Fiumorbo, in the middle of which
stood the ancient city of Aleria. In some places these
beds have been lifted without any sensible alteration of
their original form of deposit in horizontal strata, and
throughout they bear a close resemblance to the tertiary
formation of San Fiorenzo.</p>

<p>A <i>fourth</i>, and more striking, example of the same
formation is exhibited at the southern extremity of the
island. There we find an horizontal <i>plateau</i> from 200
to 300 feet high between the Gulf of Sta-Manza and Bonifacio.
The promontory on which that town and fortress
stands, and the whole adjoining coast along the straits,
present exactly the same appearances as the white chalk
cliffs of Dover; and at the <i>Cala di Canetta</i> these calcareous
rocks rise <i>&agrave; pic</i> over the sea 150 and 200 feet. There is a
perfect analogy between this formation and those of San
Fiorenzo and the Fiumorbo already mentioned. Only, this
last contains a much greater variety of fossil remains, both
animal and vegetable, consisting of lignites, oyster-shells,
large pectens, operculites, and fragments of sea-urchins,
polypi, &amp;c. We shall have an opportunity of mentioning
hereafter the curious caverns worn in the soft calcareous
rock by the force of the waves lashing this coast with so
much violence in the storms to which the Straits of Bonifacio
are exposed.</p>

<p>Coming now to the alluvial deposits, we find them
extending over the great plains on the eastern coast of the
island, the <i>littorale</i> mentioned in an early chapter of this
work. The plain of Biguglia, for instance, was formed by
one of those vast inundations which have received the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
name of diluvial currents, and swept away a great number
of species of animals. In fact, we find traces of one of
these inundations in a breccia formed of the fossil bones
of animals in the hills near Bastia. Among these fossil
bones Cuvier has remarked the head of a <i>lagomys</i>, a
little hare without any tail,&mdash;a species still existing in
Siberia.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> It would too much lengthen these remarks
were we to enter on an inquiry into the age and character
of these osseous breccia, but the curious reader
is referred to Lyell's &ldquo;Elements&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> for some interesting
observations on fossil mammalia found in alluvial deposits
alternating with breccia. We are not aware, however,
that the hills near Bastia are connected with volcanic
action as those of Auvergne, to which Mr. Lyell refers.</p>

<p>Indeed, in concluding this notice of Corsican geology,
we have only to remark that, although Corsica has no
existing volcanoes, it would appear, from fragments preserved
in the cabinets of Natural History, that, here and
there, a few rare traces of extinct volcanoes of very ancient
date have been discovered, in the neighbourhood of Porto
Vecchio, Aleria, Cape Balistro, in the Gulf of Sta Manza,
and some other places.</p>

followed up a stream tributary to it, among hills and
woods; being now on the outskirts of one of the great
forest districts of Corsica.</p>

<p>When mounting the last hill in the approach to Corte
we were joined by an inhabitant of the town, who at first
seemed disposed to amuse himself at our expense. He
was surprised, as we afterwards found, at meeting two
foreigners of somewhat rough exterior, without baggage
or attendance, engaged on rather a forlorn enterprise. He
told us that not very long before he had met an Englishman
under similar circumstances, and related some ridiculous
stories respecting him. But as I do not believe that
any of our countrymen have been recently tourists in Corsica,
I am disposed to think that the person he made his
butt was a German traveller,&mdash;a mistake we have often
found occurring in our own case in remote parts of the
Continent. We got, however, into conversation, and it
turning on forests,&mdash;a subject on which we happened to be
rather at home,&mdash;finding us to be practical people, and,
much as we admired his wild country, not inclined to over-indulgence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in sentiment and romance, he altered his tone,
and even went into the opposite extreme of supposing
that our journey was connected with a speculation in
timber. That being his hobby, we soon became great
friends. He informed us that he possessed some large
tracts of forest, which he should be happy to show us,
and our &ldquo;man of the woods&rdquo; not only performed his promise,
but, being a person of considerable intelligence,
gave us much valuable information, and rendered us many
services during our stay in Corte.</p>

<p>The approach to Corte on this side is sufficiently striking,
though not so picturesque as from the point of view on the
road to Ajaccio, from which my friend's sketch, lithographed
for this work, was taken. After winding up along
a steep ascent, the town suddenly burst on our sight from
the summit of the ridge. Its position is admirable. Seated
nearly in the centre of the island, in the heart of the
elevated <i>plateau</i> described in the preceding chapter, and
surrounded by lofty mountains, the passes of which admit
of being easily defended, with a bold insulated rock for the
base of its almost impregnable fortress, the houses of the
town clustering round it, and, beneath, a valley of exuberant
fertility, watered by two rivers, having their confluence
just above, it seems formed to be the capital of an island-kingdom,
of a nation of mountaineers. Such it was under
the government of Pascal Paoli, and during the earlier
period of the English occupation.</p>

<p>We entered the town by the Corso, its modern <i>boulevard</i>,&mdash;a
long avenue planted with trees. This and a suburb
beyond the castle, built down the slope of the hill towards
the bridge over the Tavignano, are the only regular streets
in the place. Roomy and well-furnished apartments were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
found at the Hotel Paoli on the Corso, where we met with
most kind treatment and excellent fare. My notes mention
the mutton and trout as being of superior flavour, and
a very good red wine of the country. The <i>confitures</i>&mdash;of
which an <i>armoire</i> in the <i>salle &agrave; manger</i> contained great
store, the pride of our hostess, and the perfection of her
art&mdash;were delicious, especially one composed of slices of
pear and other fruits, larded with walnuts, and preserved
in a syrup of rich grape-juice. The coffee, of course, was
excellent. Tea we found nowhere, except from our own
packets, and made, much to the general amusement, in
the coffee-pot we improvised at Bastia.</p>

<p>True to his appointment, our &ldquo;man of the woods&rdquo;
called upon us after we had dined, and accompanied us to
the principal <i>caf&eacute;</i>. It was noisy and disorderly, and we
soon adjourned to the hotel and spent the evening in very
interesting conversation. An excursion to his forest was
arranged. He told us that it abounded in game; but it
was mortifying to find that it was out of his power to
afford us any sport, the prohibition to carry fire-arms
being so rigorously enforced that no relaxation was allowed
in favour of anyone. So the <i>chasse</i> was deferred till we
landed in Sardinia.</p>

<p>The next morning was devoted to a survey of the town.
The houses and churches are mean, the only objects of
interest being the Casa Paoli and the citadel. The house
inhabited by Pascal Paoli, when Corte was the seat of
his government, is but little changed, though converted
into a college founded by the general's will. It has an
air of rude simplicity. There is still the homely cabinet
in which he wrote, his library, and a laboratory. The
library contained about a score of English books; but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
did not discover among them any of those presented by
Boswell. In the <i>salle</i> are some second-rate paintings presented
by Cardinal Fesch. The college did not seem
to be flourishing. Perhaps the most curious thing in the
house are some remains of the supports of a canopy for a
throne, which tradition says Pascal Paoli caused to be
erected in the <i>salle</i> on an occasion when his council of
state met, the canopy being surmounted by a crown. If
Paoli affected royalty, he received no encouragement from
his council, and never sat on the throne.</p>

<p>Nearly opposite is an old house formerly belonging to
Gaffori, one of the patriot leaders during the Genoese wars.
Assaulted by the enemy during the general's absence, his
heroic wife, with the help of a few adherents, barricaded
the doors and windows, and, herself, gun in hand, made
such a stout resistance, rejecting all terms of capitulation,
and threatening to blow it up and bury herself in the
ruins rather than submit, that she held it for several days
against all attacks, until her husband brought a strong
force to rescue her. The shot-holes made in the walls by
the fire of the assailants are still pointed out.</p>

<p>There is another story connected with the Gaffori family,
which the inhabitants of Corte relate with great pride.
During the War of Independence, the general's son was
carried off by the Genoese and imprisoned in the citadel
of Corte, which they then held. Assaulted by the Corsicans
with great vigour, the Genoese had the inhumanity
to suspend the boy from an embrasure where
the enemy's fire was the hottest. At this spectacle the
assailants paused in their attack, till the general ordered
them to continue their fire. Renucci, who works up the
story in his usual florid style, makes Gaffori exclaim, &ldquo;<i>Pera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
il figlio; pera la mia famiglia tutta, e trionfi la causa della
patria.</i>&rdquo; I prefer the version given me by a native of
Corte, whose father was an eye-witness of the scene:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>J'&eacute;tais
citoyen avant que je n'&eacute;tais p&egrave;re.</i>&rdquo; We shuddered
as we looked up from below at the battlement from
which the child was suspended. The fire was renewed
with still more vigour; but the child marvellously escaped,
and the garrison was forced to surrender.</p>

<p>A <i>permis</i> to visit the castle having been obtained from
the French commandant, we climbed the rocky ascent by
corkscrew steps. At present, the whole area of the rock
is embraced by the fortifications which at different periods
have grown round the massive citadel on its summit,
founded by Vincintello d'Istria in the fifteenth century.
Recently the French have cleared away some old houses
within the <i>enceinte</i> to strengthen the works.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can be the use,&rdquo; I said to our conductor, &ldquo;of
strengthening this place now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Chi s&agrave;?</i>&rdquo; was the short reply. Our friend, like many
other Corsicans we met with, still nourished the visionary
hopes which had caused his country so much blood and
misery during her long and fruitless struggles for a national
independence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>L&agrave;</i>,&rdquo; said he, pointing to the <i>grille</i> of a dungeon,
&ldquo;<i>mon p&egrave;re &eacute;tait prisonnier.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>On going our rounds, we came to the platform of a
bastion formed on the site of some of the demolished
houses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, with emotion, planting his stick on a
particular spot, &ldquo;my mother gave me birth. Here we
lived twenty-five years. She used to talk of the English
red-coats and the house of King George.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is now the residence of the family of Arrhigi, Duc de
Padoue, and contains a portrait of Madame Buonaparte,
Napoleon's mother, and several pictures connected with
the events of the emperor's life.</p>

<p>One of the sketches in my friend's portfolio was taken
in the recess of a bastion, and it required some man&#339;uvring
to interpose our Corsican friend's portly person between
the sketcher and the French sentry, as he passed and repassed&mdash;an
office which our patriotic guide performed
with much satisfaction&mdash;while a liberty was taken contrary
to the rules of fortified places.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/161.jpg" width="500" height="386" alt="CITADEL OF CORTE." title="CITADEL OF CORTE." />
<p class="caption">CITADEL OF CORTE.</p>
</div>

<p>The view from the top of the citadel, the centre of so
magnificent a panorama, may be well imagined. We now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
commanded the confluence of the two rivers, the Tavignano
and the Restonica, beneath the walls, the eye tracing up
the torrents to the gorges from which they rushed, while
the details of the town, the gardens, and vineyards, and
the ruined convents on the neighbouring hills, were
brought distinctly under view; and the mountains towered
above our heads, fitting bulwarks of the island capital.</p>

<p>In the evening we strolled down the eastern suburb,
and, crossing the bridge over the Tavignano, rambled on
to the hill above, and the ruins of the Franciscan convent
where Paoli assembled the legislative assembly, and in
which the Anglo-Corsican parliament met while Corsica
was united to England. The lithographic sketch of Corte
was taken from beyond the bridge. Faithful as it is, one
feels that neither pen nor pencil can do justice to such
a scene. Art fails to lend the colouring of the tawny-orange
vines, the pale-green olive-trees, the warm evening
tints glowing on the purple hills, the mass of shade on the
mountain sides first buried in twilight, the grey rocks, and,
far away, a&#275;rial peaks vanishing in distance.</p>

<p>A pleasant thing is the evening stroll on the outskirts
of town or village, where life offers so much novelty.
How graceful the forms of those girls at the fountain,
dipping their pitchers of antique form and a glossy green!
Poising them on their heads with one arm raised, how
lightly they trip back to the town, laughing and talking
in the sweetest of tongues&mdash;sweet in their mouths even in
its insular dialect!</p>

<p>A lazy Corsican is leading a goat, scarcely more bearded
and shaggy than its owner. Others, still lazier, and wrapped
in the rough <i>pelone</i> hanging from their shoulders like an
Irishman's frieze coat, bestride diminutive mules, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
their wives trudge by the side, carrying burdens of firewood
or vegetables on their heads and shoulders. Waggons,
drawn by oxen and loaded with wine-casks, slowly
creak along the road.</p>

<p>It is dusk as we lounge up the suburb, and the rude
houses piled up round the base of the citadel look gloomier
than ever. Light from a blazing pine-torch flashes from
the door of a <i>cave</i>; it is a wine vault. The owner welcomes
us to its dark recesses. Smeared with the juice of
the ruddy grape, he is a very priest of Bacchus; but the
processes carried on in his cave are only initiatory to the
orgies. Here are vats filled with the new-pressed juice;
there vats in the various stages of fermentation. Jolly,
as becomes his profession, he gives us to taste the sweet
must and drink the purer extract. He explains the process,
and tells us that the vintage is a fair average, though
the vine disease, the o&iuml;dion, has penetrated even into these
mountains. <i>Evoe Bacche!</i> The fumes of the reeking
cave mount to our heads, the floor is slippery with the
lees and trodden vine-leaves. We reel to the door, glad
to breathe a fresher atmosphere.</p>

<p>Calling at the <i>caf&eacute;</i> on the Corso, not from choice but
by appointment with our &ldquo;man of the woods,&rdquo; we find it,
as before, dirty, disorderly, and noisy. Where, we ask ourselves,
are the gentlemen of Corte? But what has any one,
above the classes who toil for a livelihood, to do in Corte,
except to lounge the long day under the melancholy elms
in the Corso, and wile away the evenings by petty gambling
in its wretched <i>caf&eacute;s</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Pascal Paoli more honoured than Napoleon Buonaparte.&mdash;His
Memoirs.&mdash;George III. King of Corsica.&mdash;Remarks on
the Union.&mdash;Paoli's Death and Tomb.</i></p>


<p>The suppression of brigandage, security for life and property,
the stains of blood washed from the soil, the shame
in the face of Europe wiped out,&mdash;these are signal benefits
which claim from the Corsicans a warmer homage to the
younger Napoleon than they ever paid to the first of that
name. Not even the honour of having given an emperor
to France, a conqueror to continental Europe, enlisted
the sympathies, the enthusiasm, of the islanders in the
wonderful career of their illustrious countryman. A party,
a faction, the Salicete, the Arena, the Bacchiochi, the
Abatucci, rallied round him in the first steps of his political
life, and the Cervoni, the Sebastiani, soldiers of fortune,
of the true Corsican stamp, fought his battles, and were
richly rewarded. Some of his countrymen, to their honour,
adhered to him to the end, sharing his exile in St. Helena.
But the great emperor was never popular in his own
country; he neither loved, nor was beloved by, his own
people. He did nothing for them, as before remarked,
but construct the great national roads; and that was purely
a military measure. He left them&mdash;designedly, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
seem&mdash;to cut one another's throats, and despised them
for their barbarism.</p>

<p>Pascal Paoli was, and ever will be, the popular hero of
the Corsicans. He fought their last battles for the national
independence; moulded their wild aspirations for liberty
and self-government into a constitutional form; administered
affairs unselfishly, purely, justly; encouraged industry,
and checked outrage. He was a man of the people,
one of themselves, and he never forgot it; nor have they.</p>

<p>In an Englishman's eyes, Pascal Paoli has the additional
merit of having conceived a just idea of the advantage his
country would derive from the closest union with the only
European power under whose protection a weak State
struggling for freedom could hope for repose. He did
homage to our principles, and the public feeling was with
him in England as well as in Corsica.</p>

<p>A work on Corsica that did not tell of banditti, that did
not speak of Pascal Paoli, would fail in the two points
with which the name of this island is instinctively associated.
References to the great Corsican chief have repeatedly
occurred in these Rambles, connected with
localities, and may again. We have visited his birthplace,
the scenes of his last campaign and disastrous defeat, and
now the seat of his government, Corte. We must not
leave it, though impatient to proceed on our journey and
by no means wishing to fill our pages with extraneous
matter, till we have linked together our desultory notices
by a summary review of the principal occurrences in Pascal
Paoli's remarkable life, and of the strange event which
terminated his political career,&mdash;the creation of an Anglo-Corsican
kingdom united for a time to the British Crown.</p>

<p>Pascal (Pasquale) Paoli was born at Rostino on the 25th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of April, 1725, being the second son of Giacinto Paoli,
one of the leaders of the Corsican people in their last great
struggle against the tyranny of the Genoese. Compelled
by the course of events to retire to Naples in 1739,
Giacinto Paoli was accompanied by his son Pascal,
who, inheriting his father's talents and patriotism, there
received a finished education, both civil and military.
Being much about the court, the young Corsican acquired,
with high accomplishments, those polished manners for
which he was afterwards distinguished; and he held a
commission in a regiment of cavalry, in which he did good
service in Calabria.</p>

<p>Recalled to Corsica in 1755, at the early age of thirty,
to take the supreme management of affairs in consequence
of the divisions prevailing among the patriot leaders, the
expulsion of the Genoese became his first duty; and he
soon succeeded, at least, in freeing the interior of the
island, and confining their occupation to the narrow limits
of the fortified towns on the coasts. His next step was to
remodel, or rather to create, the civil government; and
in so doing he introduced an admirable form of a representative
constitution, founded as far as possible on the
old Corsican institutions. It was, in fact, a republic, of
which Pascal Paoli was the chief magistrate, and commander
of the forces. One of the earliest acts of his
administration was a severe law for the suppression of the
bloody practice of the <i>vendetta</i>, followed in course of time
by measures for the encouragement of agriculture, and by
the foundation of a university at Corte. The necessity of
meeting the Genoese on their own element led him to get together
and equip a small squadron of ships, no country being
better fitted than Corsica, from its position and resources,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to acquire some share of naval power in the Mediterranean.
With this squadron, after repulsing the Genoese fleet, he
landed a body of troops in the island of Capraja, lying off
the coast of Corsica, and succeeded in wresting it from the
Republic.</p>

<p>Intestine divisions had always been the bane of Corsican
independence, and even Paoli's just and popular administration
could not escape the rivalry of Emanuel Matra, a
man of ancient family and great power, who became jealous
of Paoli's pre-eminence. All attempts at conciliation on
the part of Paoli proving useless, Matra and his adherents
rose in arms, and, calling the Genoese to their aid, it was
only after a long and bloody struggle, and some sharp
defeats, that Paoli and the Nationals were able to crush the
insurrection; Matra falling, after fighting desperately, in
the battle which terminated the war.</p>

<p>Pascal Paoli, being now firmly seated in power, and the
island, settled under a regular form of government, growing
in strength, the Genoese found themselves unequal to cope
with a brave and united people. After some further
ineffectual attempts, they once more applied to France for
succour, and engaged her to occupy the strong places in
the island, as she had already done from 1737 to 1741.
French troops accordingly, landing in Corsica, established
a footing which has never been relinquished, except during
the short period of English occupation. But by the Treaty
of Compiegne, signed before the expedition sailed (1764),
the French limited their support of the Genoese to a term
of four years. During that period they maintained a
strict neutrality towards the Corsican Nationals, confining
themselves to the limits of their occupation. Their generals
maintained harmonious relations with Pascal Paoli, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the Genoese power in the island having shrunk to nothing,
the patriots had the entire possession of the country, except
the fortified places, and the Commonwealth flourished
under the firm and active administration of its wise chief.
It was at this time that James Boswell visited the island.
Residing some time with General Paoli, and admitted to
familiar intercourse with him, he collected the materials
from which he afterwards compiled &ldquo;An Account of Corsica,
and Memoirs of Pascal Paoli,&rdquo; published in London
in 1767,&mdash;a work, the details of which are only equalled
by his <i>Johnsoniana</i> for their minute and vivid portraiture
of his hero's life, opinions, character, and habits. The
&ldquo;Account of Corsica&rdquo; has been the standard, indeed the
only English, work relating to that island from that day
to the present.</p>

<p>The time fixed by the Treaty of Compiegne for the
evacuation of Corsica by the French troops was on the
point of expiring. They had already withdrawn from
Ajaccio and Calvi, when the Genoese, finding themselves
utterly incapable of retaining possession of the island,
offered to cede their rights to the king of France. This
was in 1768. The Duc de Choiseul, the minister of
Louis XV., lent a willing ear to a proposal which opened
the way to the conquest of Corsica&mdash;a prize, from its
situation, its forests, its fertility, worthy the ambition of
the <i>Grand Monarque</i>. The French generals, receiving
immediate orders to cross the neutral lines, soon made
themselves masters of Capo Corso, and pushed their successes
on the eastern side of the island.</p>

<p>Pascal Paoli, his brother Clemente, and the other
national leaders, were not wanting in this crisis of the fate
of Corsica, and the people rose <i>en masse</i> against the overwhelming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
force that threatened to crush them. The war,
though necessarily short, was marked by obstinate bravery
on the part of the Corsicans. The French troops having
met with many repulses, received a signal defeat at Borgo.
There is scarcely a village in the interior that is not illustrious
for its patriotic efforts at this period. Chauvelin,
the French general-in-chief, was recalled, and, ultimately,
the Count de Vaux, an officer of experience, took the field
as generalissimo of the French army, swelled by successive
reinforcements to the vast force of 40,000 men.</p>

<p>The great blow which decided the fate of Corsica was
struck at the battle of Ponte Nuovo, of which some particulars
are given in a former chapter.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This defeat entirely
demoralised the island militia, and crushed Paoli's
hopes of maintaining the nationality of Corsica. Retiring
to Corte, and thence, almost as a fugitive, to Vivario, in
the heart of the mountains, though he might still have
maintained a <i>guerilla</i> warfare against the French, he resolved
to abandon a forlorn hope, and, pressed by a large
body of the enemy's troops, embarked in an English
frigate at Porto Vecchio, with his brother Clemente and
300 of his followers.</p>

<p>The conquest of Corsica cost France largely both in men
and money, it appearing by the official returns, that the
loss sustained in killed and wounded was 10,721 men,
while the expense of the war was estimated at 18 millions
of livres. The fate of the Corsicans met with general
sympathy. Rousseau on this occasion accused the French
people of the basest love of tyranny:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>S'ils savoient un
homme libre &agrave; l'autre bout du monde, je crois qu'ils y iroient
pour le seul plaisir de l'exterminer.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a short stay in Italy, Pascal Paoli proceeded to
England, landing at Harwich on the 18th of September,
1769. The succeeding twenty years of his life were spent
in London. He was well received by the king and queen,
and the ministers paid him the attention due to his rank
and services. But, though an object of much general
interest, he shunned publicity, living in Oxford Street in
a dignified retirement. He joined, however, in good
society, and associated with the most eminent literary
men of the day, among whom it was observed that his
talents and accomplishments as much fitted him to shine,
as at the head of his patriotic countrymen. Boswell
had the happiness of introducing him to Johnson, and
revelled in the glory of exhibiting his two lions on the
same stage.</p>

<p>The French Revolution opened the way for Pascal
Paoli's return to Corsica, with the prospect of again
devoting himself to the service of his country under a
constitutional monarchy, the form of government he most
approved. At Paris, the unfortunate Louis XVI. and his
queen received him with marks of favour, La Fayette
greeted him as a brother, and the National Assembly gave
him an enthusiastic reception. He was named President
of the Department of Corte and Commander of the National
Guard.</p>

<p>Landing in Corsica, amidst the congratulations of his
countrymen, all flocked round him, and mothers raised
their babes in their arms that they might behold the
common father of their country. The hopes of the Corsicans
again revived; for, if they had not a national and
independent government, they were members of a free
state, with the man of their choice to administer affairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Paoli was, however, soon disgusted with the excesses
of the French Revolution, and, like all citizens of distinguished
merit, he fell under the suspicions of the, so-called,
Committee of Public Safety. Summoned to the
bar of the National Convention, and declining to appear,
he was proclaimed an enemy of the Republic, and put out
of the protection of the law. Preparations were made for
exterminating the Paolists, who flew to arms, resolved
once more to assert the nationality of the Corsican people,
and throw off their dependence on France. But intestine
divisions again weakened the efforts of the patriots, and
Corsica was divided into two parties&mdash;the Paolists and
the Republicans; the Buonaparte family at this time supporting
the patriot chief.</p>

<p>In the face of the new invasion threatened by the
French Republic, Paoli perceived that there was nothing
to be done but to call the English, whose fleet hovered on
the coast, to the aid of the Nationals, and place the island
under British protection. The firstfruits of this alliance
were the reduction of San Fiorenzo and the surrender of
Bastia to the bold attack of Nelson already described.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
The fall of these fortresses was succeeded by the siege of
Calvi, in which Nelson also distinguished himself; and
on the reduction of that place&mdash;Ajaccio and Bonifacio
being already in the hands of the patriots&mdash;the French
troops withdrew from the island.</p>

<p>Corsica being once more free to establish a national
government, the representatives of the people, assembled
in a convention at Corte on the 14th of June, 1794,
accepted a constitution framed by Pascal Paoli, in conjunction
with Sir Gilbert Elliot, the British Plenipotentiary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
By this national act the sovereignty of Corsica
was hereditarily conferred on the King of Great Britain
with full executive rights; the legislative power, including
especially the levying of taxes, being vested in an assembly
called a parliament, composed of representatives elected in
the several <i>pi&egrave;ves</i> and towns. All Corsicans of the age of
twenty-five years, possessed of real property (<i>beni fondi</i>),
and domiciled for one year in a <i>pi&egrave;ve</i> or town, were entitled
to vote at the elections. The king's consent was
required to give force to all laws, and he had the prerogative
of summoning, proroguing, and dissolving the parliament.
A viceroy, appointed by the sovereign, with a
council and secretary of state, were to execute the functions
of government. The press was to be free. In short,
the kingdom of Corsica&mdash;so called even under the dominion
of the Genoese Republic&mdash;was to be a limited
monarchy, with institutions nearly resembling those of
Great Britain, except that there was no House of Peers.</p>

<p>The subject has some interest, even at this present day,
as showing how the principles of a limited monarchy
were adapted by such a man as Pascal Paoli to a <i>quasi</i>-Italian
nation, than which none could be more ardent in
their love of freedom, or have made greater struggles in
its cause. The Constitutional Act<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> will be found in the
appendix to Mr. Benson's work. It is curious also to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
that in the time of our George III. a kingdom in the
Mediterranean was as closely united to the Crown of Great
Britain, as the kingdom of Ireland was at that time.</p>

<p>Sir Gilbert Elliot was appointed viceroy. Unfortunately,
with the best dispositions, his government was
not administered with the tact required to conciliate so
irascible a people as the Corsicans. While the viceroy
was personally esteemed and beloved, he pursued a course
of policy little calculated to calm the irritation which
speedily arose. Pascal Paoli felt disappointment at not
having been nominated viceroy, and was suspected of
secretly fomenting the disaffection to the government.
So far from this, he published an address to his countrymen,
endeavouring to allay the ferment, and induce obedience
to the English authorities. Jealousy, however, of
his great and well-earned influence over the Corsicans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
appears to have led to his removal from the island.
Towards the close of the year 1795 the king's command
that he should repair to England was conveyed to him,
couched, however, in gracious terms. He immediately
obeyed, and arrived in London towards the end of
December.</p>

<p>No sooner had Paoli departed than discontent assumed
a more alarming form. His presence and example had
kept many calm who had been secretly hostile to the
English, but who now openly displayed their animosity.
Petitions were presented to the viceroy by some of the
leading inhabitants assembled at Bistuglio, declaring the
grounds of Corsican opposition, and proposing means of
conciliation; while many bodies of the disaffected assembled
in the wild neighbourhood of Bocagnono. These
disorders, coupled with the mutual distrust with which
the Corsicans and English viewed each other, finally led
to the abandonment of the island by the latter; and, accordingly,
between the 14th and 20th of October, 1796,
the viceroy and troops, under the protection of Nelson,
embarked for Porto Ferrajo, leaving the island once more
a prey to French invasion.</p>

<p>Foreign writers sneer at the ignorance and mismanagement
which so soon alienated the minds of the Corsicans
from those whom they had lately hailed as their liberators
and protectors; and it may perhaps be lamented that so
noble a dependency of the British Crown was thus lost.
Its commanding position in the Mediterranean, its fine
harbours and magnificent forests, made it a most desirable
position, at least during the revolutionary war. Such was
Nelson's opinion, expressed in a letter to his wife when a
descent on the coast was first contemplated. Added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
these, its products of corn, wine, and oil, capable of almost
indefinite augmentation under a good system of government,
gave it great value as a permanent possession.
What are Malta and Gibraltar? Merely rock fortresses,
compared with such an island, capable of defence by the
bravest people in the world, and possessed of such resources
that, so far from being a burden on the finances, a very
considerable surplus of the revenue now flows into the
Imperial exchequer. Nothing was wanting but to reconcile
the natives to the rule of their new masters, making it,
as it constitutionally professed to be, national. This was
doubtless a difficult task with a spirited people, alien in
race, religion, and habits. The ministers of the day committed
a great error in not giving the vice-royalty to Pascal
Paoli. He was a thorough Anglo-Corsican, and perfectly
understood the working of a constitutional government.
The union had been his policy, and he alone could have
carried it out.</p>

<p>Whether the annexation of the island to the British
Empire would have survived the deliberations of the Congress
of Vienna is another question. One does not see
why it should not have done so. We retained the Ionian
Islands, less important in many respects, and with a population
as turbulent, it seems, and as alien, as the Corsicans.
The possession of Corsica by the Bourbons was very
recent, and acquired by the most flagrant injustice. The
French were scarcely more popular than the English with
the national party; nor are they, according to the impression
made during our Rambles, at the present day.
The island had been offered to Napoleon, and might have
become his island-empire. Had it even followed the fate
of Genoa, its former mistress, and been assigned to Sardinia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
there would be reason now for all friends of constitutional
government to rejoice; and the Corsicans, essentially an
Italian people, would more easily have amalgamated with
their rulers.</p>

<p>However, these are mere speculations. Pascal Paoli's
retirement left his native island no resource but submission
to the French, and it became once more a department
of France, one and undivided. On his return to
England, Paoli had a small pension from the English
Government, which he shared with other exiles from his
own country. Little is known of the latter years of his
life. He probably resumed, as far as his advanced years
admitted, the habits he had formed during his former
residence in London. He died there, on the 25th of
February, 1807, at the age of eighty-two, and was interred
in the burial-ground of Old St. Pancras. It is
ground especially hallowed in the estimation of Roman
Catholics; and if any reader should chance to turn his
steps in that direction, he will be surprised to see what a
large proportion of the monuments and gravestones in the
vast area are inscribed to the memory of foreigners of all
ranks, who, during a long course of years, have ended
their days in London. The little antique church, too&mdash;one
of the oldest, if not the oldest, in London&mdash;is well
worth a visit, as an interesting specimen of Romanesque
architecture, well restored a few years ago.</p>

<p>In the south-western corner of the churchyard, not far
from the boundary wall, he will find a rather handsome
tomb marking the spot in which the remains of the great
Corsican are deposited. It bears on one face a long Latin
inscription, said to have been penned by one of his countrymen,
and the east slab bears a coronet, on what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
authority we are at a loss to conceive. So also the more
humble monument of Theodore of Corsica at St. Anne's,
Soho, is dignified with a shadowy crown. The mock king
created Giacinto Paoli, Pascal's father, and one of his
first ministers of state, a marquis or count. Can it be
that, under that patent, Pascal Paoli assumed the insignia
of nobility in his intercourse with the courtly circles of
London? Was it a weakness in the man of the people,
who, simple as his general habits were, had high breeding,
and, as we learn from Boswell's gossip, was not entirely
free from aristocratic tendencies,&mdash;nay, is said to have
aspired to a royal crown?<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Or is the coronet on his
tomb an unauthorised device of the officious friends who
are said to have spent 500<i>l.</i> in giving the exile a pompous
funeral?</p>

<p>Peace to his memory! In death, as in life, his heart
was with the people he had loved and served so well.
Still caring for their best interests, by a codicil to his will
he appropriated the annual sum of 200<i>l.</i> to the endowment
of four professors in a college he proposed to found
at Corte. They were to teach&mdash;1st. The Evidences of
Christianity;&mdash;2nd. Ethics and the Laws of Nations;&mdash;3rd.
The Principles of Natural Philosophy;&mdash;and 4th. The
Elements of Mathematics. He also bequeathed a salary
of 50<i>l.</i> to a schoolmaster in his native <i>pi&egrave;ve</i> of Rostino,
who was to instruct the children in reading, writing, and
arithmetic. It appears to have been the object of Mr.
Benson's journey to Corsica to carry into effect these wise
and benevolent provisions, and Paoli's bequests to his
poor relations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Paoli said when dying:&mdash;&ldquo;My nephews have little to
expect from me; but I will bequeath to them, as a
memorial and consolation, this Bible&mdash;saying, &#8216;I have
never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging

<p class="blockquot"><i>Excursion to a Forest.&mdash;Borders of the Niolo.&mdash;Adventures.&mdash;Corsican
Pines.&mdash;The Pinus Maritima and Pinus
Luriccio.&mdash;Government Forests.</i></p>


<p>Our excursion to the forest came off on the day before
we left Corte, under the auspices of our &ldquo;man of the
woods.&rdquo; He procured us mules, and our hostess supplied
a basket of provisions and wine; for it promised to be a
hard day's work, carrying us far into the heart of the
mountains.</p>

<p>Leaving Corte by the Corso, we soon turned up a valley
to the left, winding among hills of no great elevation and
cultivated to their summits. Not much farther than a
mile from the town, we passed a lone house, the door of
which was riddled with bullets. The brigands attacked it
not long before. It was an affair, I believe, of summary
justice for some trespass on property.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one was safe,&rdquo; said our conductor, &ldquo;two years ago,
outside the town. If you had been in the island then,
you would have seen half Corsica armed to the teeth.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The disarming has been complete, for since our landing
we have only once seen fire-arms except in the hands of
the military. Then the banditti, of whom we have heard
more than enough, no longer exist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; they have been shot down, brought to justice,
or driven out of the island. Many of them escaped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Sardinia; if you go there, you will find things just in the
same state they were here; perhaps worse, if our outlaws
are roaming there. I will tell you, some time, the story
of the last of the banditti. Not far from hence they fell
in a desperate conflict with the gendarmes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hollows between some of the hills among which
we wound were embosomed in chestnut-trees, and the
husks were beginning to burst and shed the nuts on the
ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The harvest is approaching,&rdquo; said our guide. &ldquo;Soon
every house will have great heaps gathered in for the
winter's store.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were on the borders of the mountainous district of
the <i>Niolo</i>, the most primitive, not only geologically, as we
have lately seen, but in point of manners, of any in Corsica.
This it owes to its sequestered situation, hemmed in
by the southern branch of the great central chain. It is
approached by difficult paths and steps hewn out of the
rock, the best being the pass of the <i>Santa Regina</i>. The
interior of the bason is, however, extremely fertile. We
had now in view the Monte Cinto and Monte Artica, the
principal summits of the Niolo group, nearly 8000 feet
high; and from part of our route Monte Rotondo was
seen rising, with its snowy crest, a thousand feet higher,
further to the south.</p>

<p>The country now assumed a wilder and more rugged
character, cultivation disappeared, and the surface was
either rocky or thickly covered with the natural shrubbery
so often mentioned. Once more we were in the
<i>Macchia</i>, threading it by a rough and narrow path.
Flocks of sheep and goats were browsing among the
bushes; and the sight of rude shepherds' huts, with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
blazing fires, gave us to understand that we had reached
the wilds beyond human habitation. At last, a steep
ascent through the thickets by a slippery path surmounted
a ridge commanding the prospect of one flank of a mountain,
the forest property of our &ldquo;man of the woods.&rdquo; A
furious torrent, its natural boundary, tumbled and dashed
in its rocky channel far beneath. Our mules slid down
the almost precipitous descent clothed with dense underwood;
we forded the stream, and met our friend's forester,
who was expecting our arrival, and had shouted to us as
we crossed the ridge.</p>

<p>A storm of rain poured down in torrents while we were
clambering up the opposite heights, making for shelter
with as much speed as such an ascent permitted. Our
place of refuge was a well-known haunt of the shepherds
and banditti. It could not be called a cave, but was a
hollow under a mass of insulated rock, worn away in the
disintegrated granite, the harder shell of which formed an
umbrella-shaped canopy, protecting us from the rain. It
was miserably cold; but there were no dry materials at
hand for lighting a fire, though the blackened rock and
heaps of ashes and half-burnt logs looked very tempting.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, the best thing to be done
was to apply ourselves to the contents of Madame &mdash;&#8212;'s
basket, as we had still harder work before us. The contents
were just displayed when my fellow-traveller made
his appearance. I had lost sight of him in the bush
while hurrying on, he having dismounted, and left his
mule to be led up by a shepherd. He, too, had sought
shelter in the nearest rock he could find. It had a cavity
with a low aperture, into which he thrust himself head-foremost.
What was his surprise at beholding a pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
eyes glaring at him through the gloom! The thing&mdash;whether
it were man or beast he could not at the moment
distinguish&mdash;shrunk back. He, too, recoiled and made a
sudden exit. Presently he saw a pair of legs protruding on
the further side of the rock, which it appeared was perforated
from both extremities, and the thing, serpent-like,
gradually wriggled itself out. Then stood erect, shaggy
and rough as a wild beast startled from its lair, one of the
shepherd boys, who had also crept into the cavity for
refuge from the storm. He cast one look of astonishment
at the intruder, turned round, and, leaping into the bush,
disappeared without uttering a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he took you for a detective in plain clothes,
conscience-struck for having assisted to harbour the proscribed
brigands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our meal despatched, and the weather clearing, we
began clambering up a mountain side, as steep as the
ridge of a house; and the mules, being useless, were sent
down in charge of the muleteer to the ford of the torrent.
Signor F&mdash;&#8212;'s forest spread over the whole face of the
mountain, and how much further he best knew. We understood
that he had a larger tract in another direction.</p>

<p>Trackless pine forests&mdash;some belonging to the communes,
others to private individuals,&mdash;clothe the lower
ranges of the mountains through all this part of the island.
Vizzavona, which we crossed on our way to Ajaccio, and
Aitona, lying to the south-west of the Niolo, belong to
the State, and the French Admiralty draw from them
large supplies of timber shipped to Toulon; especially the
finest masts used in their navy. The Corsican pine-forests
have been famous from early times. Theophrastus<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> mentions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
a ship built by the Romans with this timber, of such
large dimensions as to carry fifty sails; and Sextus Pompeius,
seizing this island as well as Sicily and Sardinia,
drew from its forests the means of maintaining his naval
supremacy.</p>

<p>Our &ldquo;man of the woods&rdquo; appeared to have hardly
earned, and well to merit, the noble property in the possession
of which he rejoiced. Yet he described himself as
poor in the midst of his seeming wealth, impoverished to
get together vast tracts of country, from which, at present,
he received no return. His object was to obtain a market
for sale of his timber, which he said could be floated down
the rivers to the sea-coast at a moderate expense. Having
seen, as we had, the Norwegian timber floating down
rivers, precipitated over rapids, and rafted over immense
lakes, during a <i>flottage</i> to the sea which it sometimes
takes two years to accomplish<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, we could find no difficulty
in believing that advantage might be taken of the rivers
on either watershed of the central chain in Corsica, to
bear this, the only wealth of these elevated regions, to the
coast, which is nowhere more than about fifty miles distant.
Of the anchorage and depth of water at the mouths of the
rivers, I have no precise information, except so far that
Signor F&mdash;&#8212; assured us there would be no difficulty in
shipping his timber.</p>

<p>I had not counted on such an exhausting effort as climbing
a thousand feet nearly perpendicular on the rocky and
rugged surface of a mountain forest in Corsica demanded.
Accustomed to traverse some of the finest pine-forests of
Norway in a light <i>carriole</i> on excellent roads, or to canter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
along their avenues on little spirited horses, its native
breed, without any feeling of fatigue, I had imagined our
present enterprise to be much easier than it proved.
Indeed, had it not been that the tangled roots of the pines,
forming a network on the denuded surface of the rocks,
afforded secure footing and a firm hold, and that, clasping
the giant stems, one could take breath on the edge of the
shelving cliffs, I should never have scrambled, and pulled
myself, up to the summit.</p>

<p>Our &ldquo;man of the woods,&rdquo; notwithstanding his great
bulk, was agile as a mountain-goat, leaping from crag to
crag, and striking off in every direction where he could
show us trees of the largest growth. Marmocchi mentions
four species of the pine in his catalogue of the indigenous
trees growing in Corsica. Of two of these, <i>Pinus Pinea</i>
(the stone pine), and <i>Pinus Sylvestris</i> (our common Scotch
fir), I did not remark any specimens in the forests we
had an opportunity of examining, nor do they equal the
others in grandeur and value. But both the <i>Pinus Lariccio</i>
and the <i>Pinus Maritima</i> are magnificent trees. They
were mingled in the forest I am now describing, the
<i>Lariccio</i> prevailing.</p>

<p>The <i>Pinus Maritima</i>, so well known to all travellers in
Italy and Greece, and to others by its picturesque effect
in the landscapes of Claude, has often its trunk clear of
boughs till near the top, which spreads out in an umbrella-shaped
head, with a dense mass of foliage; and, where the
stem is not so denuded, the tree has the same rounded
contour of boughs. Both are figured and described in
Lambert's magnificent work on the <span class="smcap">Genus Pinus</span>; but,
unfortunately, from very insignificant specimens; those of
the Pinus Maritima being taken from a tree at Sion House,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
only twenty feet high. The spines of the Pinus Maritima
are longer than those of the Pinus Lariccio,
and the branches more pensile. The engravings
for the present work are from specimens
brought from Corsica. Mr. Lambert's
description, however, coincides with my own
observations in the Corsican forests. He says:-&ldquo;The
branches are very numerous, and bear
long filiform leaves. The cones are nearly
the same size as Pinus Rigida. They are so
remarkably smooth and glossy, that they at
once distinguish their species. In shedding
their seeds, they seem to expand very little.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Mr. Lambert considers it to be the same
species as the &#960;&#949;&#973;&#954;&#959;&#962;, <i>Pinus Picea</i> of Greece,
which grow on the high mountains, Olympus,
Pindus, Parnassus, &amp;c.; and quotes an extract
from Dr. Sibthorp's papers, published in Walpole's
<i>Turkey</i>, remarking that the &#960;&#949;&#973;&#954;&#959;&#962; furnished a useful
resin, used in Attica to preserve wine
from becoming acid, and supplying
tar and pitch for shipping. &ldquo;The
resinous parts of the wood,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;are cut into small pieces,
and serve for candles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Pinus Lariccio</i> is more disposed
to retain its lower branches
than the Pinus Maritima, and has
a more angular character both in
the boughs and the footstalks of
its tassels. The spines are shorter. The boughs slightly
droop, but by no means in the degree of the spruce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
fir or the <i>larch</i>. From this circumstance, however, it
probably derives its name, though it has nothing else in
the slightest degree common with the larch; and writers
who speak of the &ldquo;Corsican larch&rdquo; betray their readers
into serious error. The Pinus Lariccio is figured in Mr.
Lambert's work from two specimens in the Jardin des
Plantes at Paris, about thirty feet high and three feet in
girth, in 1823. Their age is not mentioned. Don, quoted
in this work, remarks that &ldquo;this pine is totally distinct
from all the varieties of Pinus Sylvestris, with which, however,
it in some respects agrees. It differs in the branches
being shorter and more regularly verticellate. The leaves
are one-third longer; cones shorter,
ovate, and quite straight, with depressed
scales, opening freely to
shed the seed. The wood is more
weighty, resinous, and, consequently,
more compact, stronger, and more
flexible than Pinus Sylvestris. Its
bark is finer and much more entire.&rdquo;
The Pinus Lariccio is also at once
distinguishable from the Pinus Maritima growing in the
same forest, by the bark alone.
Drawings are here given of (1)
the exterior and (2) interior
coats, from specimens brought
from Corsica. They are very
thick, and peel off in large
flakes, the inner layer being
most delicately veined, and of
a rich crimson hue.</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;I observed,&rdquo; says Mr. Hawkins, quoted by Lambert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
&ldquo;on Cyllene, Taygetus, and the mountains of Thasos, a
sort of fir, which, though called &#960;&#949;&#973;&#954;&#959;&#962; by the inhabitants,
and resembling that of the lower regions, has the foliage
much darker, and the growth of the tree more regular and
straight. The elevated region on which it grew leads me
to suspect it must be different from the common &#960;&#949;&#973;&#954;&#959;&#962;.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Mr. Lambert adds:&mdash;&ldquo;The Pinus Lariccio is, I have no
doubt, the tree here mentioned, especially as it is known
to grow in Greece, and has been found by Mr. Webb
near the summit of Mount Ida, in Phrygia.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> We are
inclined, however, to think that this remark requires confirmation
by more exact details.</p>

<p>The Pinus Lariccio grows to a greater height than the
Pinus Maritima. In this forest Signor F&mdash;&#8212; estimated
some of the finest specimens of the latter at from sixty to
seventy feet in length, while those of the Lariccio could
not be less than 120 feet, and perhaps more, with an
average circumference of about nine feet. Some little
experience enabled us to confirm this estimate.</p>

<p>But these dimensions are often exceeded. In the
neighbouring forest of Valdianello, which, again, abuts on
that of Aitona, the chief of the government reserves, there
lately stood a Pinus Lariccio, called by the Corsicans &ldquo;<i>Le
Roi des Arbres</i>.&rdquo; At five feet from the ground its girth was
upwards of nineteen feet. The height of the tree is not
mentioned. The king of the forest is dead, but it boasts a
successor worthy of its honours, the girth being, as Marmocchi
relates on report, twenty-six feet at one m&egrave;tre
(three feet three inches) from the ground, and only reduced
to twenty-one feet where the trunk is fifty-eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
feet high. Its entire height is 150 feet, and its branches
cover a circumference nearly 100 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>These dimensions are large for European pines, about averaging
those of the Norwegian. Growing in a rocky soil,
I can easily believe that the timber is, as represented, extremely
durable. It was surprising to see in Signor F&mdash;&#8212;'s
forest trees of such magnitude springing from fissures in the
granite cliffs, and from ledges of rocks having only a scanty
covering of barren soil. The growth must be slow; by
counting the rings in some of the fallen trees, I calculated
that they had stood about two centuries. The choicest
specimens were usually grouped on some platform, or in
hollows of the precipitous cliffs. In these positions they
are often exposed to the worst of enemies, such spots being
the haunts of the brigands and shepherds; and it was
lamentable to observe the destruction caused by their fires
in all parts of the wood. Huge half-burnt logs lay at the
foot of some of the finest pines, and the flames had not
only scorched all vegetation within reach, but eaten into
the heart of the trees.</p>

<p>This may be considered as one of the few virgin forests
remaining in Corsica. The vast consumption by the
Genoese, and afterwards by the French, governments, has
greatly exhausted the forests; and it is only in the inaccessible
parts of the country, where there are no roads,
that timber of large dimensions is found. Even here they
were felling the smaller trees, sawing them into planks,
and carrying them away on mules, one plank balancing
another on each side of the pack-saddle. We ventured to
suggest to our &ldquo;man of the woods&rdquo; the advantages of sawmills,
a machinery of the simplest possible construction,
adopted in North America, Norway, and all forest countries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
where, as here, there is abundant water-power. All
such industrial resources are wanting in Corsica, but our
friend was too shrewd not to be alive to the value of the
suggestion.</p>

<p>Our course through the forest had led us round to the
flank of the mountain, shelving down to the torrent we
forded on our arrival. A descent is generally considered an
easy affair: so we found this in comparison with the ascent;
but the declivity was formidable, there being no sort of
path, and we had to work our way over and amongst huge
masses of rock and slippery boulders, and jumping from
crag to crag, sliding, rolling, and tumbling, not without
some severe falls, we at last reached the bottom.</p>

<p>Remounting our mules, a very pleasant change&mdash;active,
light-stepping beasts as they were,&mdash;we rode slowly on our
return to Corte, often looking back at the broad forest-clad
mountains, with the snowy dome of Monte Rotondo in
the distance. Signor F&mdash;&#8212;, anxious to supply us with all
the information we required, lost no opportunity of pointing
out remarkable objects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see that <i>pa&eacute;se</i>?&rdquo; he said, pointing to some
grey buildings about five miles off, on the right bank
of the Golo; &ldquo;that is Soveria, the birth-place of Cervione,
one of Napoleon's best generals. He fell in the battle of
Ratisbon. His last words to the emperor, when ordered
on a desperate attack,&rdquo; said our friend, with Corsican
feeling &ldquo;were, &#8216;<i>Je vous recommande ma famille</i>.&#8217;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Valery relates an amusing anecdote of this General
Cervione. Having the command at Rome, which he
exercised with great severity, it became his duty to convey
the order to Pope Pius VII. for abdicating his temporal
power and being sent away, which he executed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
harshly. When Pius VII. was afterwards at the Tuileries,
Cervione, with other generals, came to pay him his respects.
The pope, struck by his pure Italian pronunciation,
complimented him on it. &ldquo;<i>Santo Padre</i>,&rdquo; said Cervione,
&ldquo;<i>sono quasi Italiano.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Come?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Sono Corso.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Oh!
oh!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Sono Cervione.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Oh! oh! oh!</i>&rdquo;
At this terrible recollection the pope shrank aghast, hastily
retreating to the fireside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Further on,&rdquo; said our conductor, &ldquo;I see it plainly,
there is an old grey house on the top of a rock; a poor
place, but the birthplace of Pascal Paoli. He resided
there after he became our chief, but would not have the
home of his fathers altered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Near Soveria is Alando, the native place of Sambuccio,
the patriot leader in the first insurrection against the
Genoese. All the neighbourhood of Corte is classic
ground in Corsican history.</p>

<p>We returned there to a late dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Our good &ldquo;man of the woods&rdquo; joined us at dinner. It
was a just source of pride to him that he had shown his
magnificent forest to foreigners as enthusiastic as himself,
and who might, perhaps, forward his designs for making
it profitable. In this view he now wrote the subjoined

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<p>We had already inquired what sport such covers afforded,
and the account given of deer and wild boars, not to
speak of smaller game, was very tempting. There were
bears in the forests in the time of Flippini the historian,
but for the last century they have been extinct. There
are no wolves; but the foxes are plentiful, and so strong
that they venture to attack the flocks of sheep and goats.
The Corsican <i>cerf</i> is like the red deer. Their colour is
ferruginous. In size they are a little larger than fallow
deer with a heavier body, and stronger horns, springing
upright, spreading less than any other variety, and slightly
palmated. Both male and female have a dark line down
the back, rump, and scut. The <i>moufflon</i> or <i>muffori</i> is a
most curious animal, almost peculiar, I believe, to this
island and Sardinia, though a variety of the species is
found in Morocco. Something between a sheep, a deer, and
a goat, the male has spiral horns like a goat, rather turned
back, with the legs and hind-quarter of a goat, but the
head of a sheep. The colour is a reddish brown, with
some admixture of black and white, brown predominating.
The skin is fine-grained, not woolly but fine-haired, like a
deer. It is extremely agile, jumping from rock to rock
with surprising leaps, and so wild that, like the chamois
and the reindeer, it frequents only the highest mountains,
close to the snow-line, in summer, descending, as the
snow extends, to lower regions. When the winters are
very severe, and the snow covers the ground, it is driven
into some of the higher valleys, and has been known to
take refuge in the stables among the tame sheep and goats.
The <i>moufflon</i> goes in troops of from four to twenty. The
females drop their young on the edge of the snow in the
month of May. There are full-grown specimens of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
<i>moufflon</i> in the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park, and
in the <i>Jardin de Plantes</i>, at Paris.</p>

<p>Of smaller game, Corsica abounds in hares and red
partridges, the only species found in the island. In winter
there are woodcocks, snipes, and water-fowl, and a <i>grande
chasse</i> of thrushes, which, feeding on the berries of the
arbutus, the lentiscus, and the myrtle, become very fat,
have a fine flavour, and are esteemed a great delicacy.</p>

<p>But all these varieties of game were forbidden fruit, as
a <i>permis</i> to carry fire-arms could not be obtained by any
class of persons, or for any purpose whatever. The shepherds
have only their dogs to protect their flocks. If the
prohibition continues long, the wild animals must become
the pest of the island, and with their natural increase
there will be splendid shooting when the use of fire-arms
is again allowed. But for the hope of better sport in Sardinia,
we thought of getting up a boar hunt, with spears,
in the fashion so picturesquely seen in old pictures, and a
much more spirited affair than shooting pigs. For deer
and birds there is nothing left but to fall back on bows
and arrows, as long as the Corsicans cannot be trusted
with fire-arms, lest the <i>genus homo</i> should be their prey.</p>

<p>It was the last evening we spent with our &ldquo;man of the
woods.&rdquo; He was very communicative, and, among other
things, told us many stories of the heroic deeds of his
countrymen in former times, and of the wild life of Corsica,
which has only just expired. I preserve one of his
tales, relating a recent event, which happily closes the
bloody chapter of Corsican banditism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>


<p class="title"><i>The Last of the Banditti.</i></p>

<p>Two brothers, Pierre-Jean and Xavier-Saverio Massoni,
men of extraordinary vigour and desperate courage, banded
with Arrhigi, another determined outlaw, had for many
years been the terror of the wild district of the <i>Niolo</i> in
which they harboured, and of the neighbouring country.
Many were the families they had reduced to misery by
cutting off their fathers and brothers; but they had numerous
friends, whom they protected. They shared the scanty
fare of the shepherds in the mountains, and the people
entertained them in their houses; some, <i>par amiti&eacute;</i>, with
cordiality and kindness, others from fear. Such was the
renown of these banditti chiefs that the authorities used
every effort to exterminate them, offering large rewards
for their heads, and threatening with severe penalties any
who should supply them with the means of existence.</p>

<p>At length a shepherd, who had received some injury
from one of the band, betrayed their hiding-place in the
fastnesses of the <i>Niolo</i> to the <i>gendarmes</i>. Led by him
through tracks known only to the shepherds and banditti,
before daylight on a morning of the month of October,
1851, a body of the <i>gendarmerie</i>, twenty or thirty in
number, reached the neighbourhood in which the three
resolute bandits were concealed. It was a place called
Penna-Rosa, near Corscia, a village in the canton of
Calacuccia, not very far from Corte.</p>

<p>The bandits are in the habit of separating for their
greater security. At this time Pierre Massoni was alone
in one of the caves among the rocks; Xavier Massoni and
Arrhigi together occupied another. The <i>gendarmes</i>, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
active and resolute as the banditti, their mortal foes, with
whom they often had desperate encounters, crept towards
the cave occupied by Pierre, who, seeing the disparity of
numbers, crept into the bush, and attempted to escape,
probably intending to join his friends, and with them
make a determined resistance. The <i>gendarmes</i> fired a
volley, and Pierre fell mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Xavier and Arrhigi had, somehow, received intelligence
of the approach of the <i>gendarmes</i>, and hastening to the
spot found them posted in front of the cave. A shot from
each of the brigands brought down two of their enemies;
and during the confusion caused by this unexpected diversion,
the <i>gendarmes</i> drawing off, Xavier Massoni, supposing
that his brother was concealed in the cave, shouted
to him&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pierre, come out; I have cleared the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This cry drew the attention of the <i>gendarmes</i>, and at the
same moment he was shot in the thigh by one of the
party. A general fire was then opened, but Xavier contrived
to creep into the bush, and afterwards made his
escape over the mountains, while Arrhigi fled for refuge to
a deep and almost inaccessible cavern. The party followed
him, and posted themselves, under cover of the rocks, near
the mouth of the cave into which they supposed he had
retired, for they had not seen him enter; and as the access
was so narrow that it could only be attempted by one at a
time, the attempt to reconnoitre would have been certain
death.</p>

<p>The <i>gendarmes</i>, though numbering at least twenty to
one, thus held at bay by one man, the bravest of the
brave, sent a messenger to Corte to demand a reinforcement.
Four hundred troops were detached for this service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
They were accompanied by the <i>sous-pr&eacute;fet</i>, the
<i>procureur imperial</i>, a captain of engineers, and men with
ammunition to blow up the cave. It was a four hours'
march from Corte, and they arrived late in the day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <i>gendarmes</i> beleaguered the spot, keeping
under cover. The brave Arrhigi kept close, watchful no
doubt. He must have had a stout heart; but we do not
paint, we only give the leading details; the reader's imagination
will supply the rest.</p>

<p>At length the troops marched up. A French <i>gendarme</i>,
boldly or incautiously, approached the entrance; he was
shot dead on the spot. Then, no doubt was left that
Arrhigi was there. Either to spare life, or because no one
was found bold enough to lead the forlorn hope in storming
the entrance, it was resolved to blow up the cave.
The engineers set to work, a shaft was sunk from above, a
barrel of gunpowder was lodged in it&mdash;the explosion was
ineffectual; it left the massive vault and sides of the narrow
cavern as firm as ever. It was too deep to be reached
without regular mining. Besides, the night was bitter,
and the whole party shaking with cold.</p>

<p>Engineering operations were abandoned. As they could
neither beard the bandit in his den, nor blow him up, it
was determined to starve him out. The troops bivouacked,
fires were lighted, and sentinels posted. The siege was
converted into a blockade, all in due military order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Centinelle, prend garde &agrave; vous!</i>&rdquo; was passed from
post to post. &ldquo;<i>Centinelle, prend garde &agrave; moi!</i>&rdquo; answered
the bold Arrhigi from his rocky hold.</p>

<p>The blockade was maintained for five days and four
nights, not without some loss on the part of the besiegers,
for Arrhigi opened fire from time to time, as opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
offered, and no less than seven of his enemies were struck
down by his unerring bullets. Some were wounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brave soldiers of Napoleon,&rdquo; cried Arrhigi, &ldquo;carry off
your wounded comrades, who want your assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems extraordinary that 400 troops should be held
at bay by a single man for so long a period; but such was
the fact. Perhaps the officials hoped to take him alive, or
they might wish to spare a further effusion of blood in
actual conflict with the desperate bandit. Arrhigi's cavern
had a small store of provisions and some gourds of water.
When these were expended, he resolved on making a last
effort to force his way through the troops. Could he have
stood out a day longer, he might probably have escaped, as
the weather became so tempestuous that it would have
been impossible for them to maintain their exposed position
in those bleak mountains.</p>

<p>On the fourth night, just before the dawn of day, he
made the attempt. Dashing from the cavern, and shooting
down the nearest sentries right and left with his
double-barrelled gun, he gained the thickets. An alarm
was raised, and there was a general pursuit. Arrhigi fled
towards the Golo, intending, probably, to place that river
between him and his pursuers. It was now daylight, and
they were upon him before he reached it. Again brought
to bay, he took his stand sheltered by a rock. The soldiers
cried out to him to surrender; but the resolute bandit,
refusing quarter, continued to resist till he was shot
through the head.</p>

<p>We left Xavier Massoni escaping into the <i>maquis</i>, but
slightly wounded in the thigh. The <i>gendarmes</i> were so
occupied with his brother Pierre and Arrhigi, that he
reached, unpursued, a distant forest in the heart of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
mountains. Soon, however, an officer of the <i>Gendarmerie
Corse</i>, with a detachment of forty or fifty men, was laid
on his track. After seven days they discovered the lone
cave in which, the last of his band, he had hoped for concealment.
It was high up the face of the mountain, but
the party scaled it, and summoning Xavier to surrender,
he gave his <i>parole</i>. Just at that moment a <i>gendarme</i> offering
a shot, the bandit levelled his gun at him and killed
him. He then threw down his arms and came out of the
cave, prepared to surrender himself. A sentry posted near,
imagining that he intended to escape, shot him dead
without challenging him or allowing him time to give
himself up. The sentry was punished, as they wished to
take the bandit alive, hoping that he would discover those
who were in league with him.</p>

<p>Thus fell, with a gallantry worthy of a better cause,
these renowned banditti chiefs, who for many years had
infested the country, and filled it with alarm and grief.
The rest of the band dispersed, were killed, or taken
prisoners. Arrhigi's heroic defence closed the series of
romantic stories on which the Corsicans delight to dwell.
His example might have encouraged the outlaws to emulate
his daring resistance; but the unusual force brought
against him convinced them that the authorities were no
longer to be trifled with. The brigands became thoroughly
disheartened, and we hear of no more desperate encounters
with the <i>gendarmerie</i>. In the course of the following
year, the deep solitudes of the Corsican forests and mountains,
echoing no longer to the crack of the rifle, were left
in the undisturbed possession of the shepherds and their
flocks, the foxes and the <i>moufflons</i>.</p>

<p>There is another version of the story of the Massoni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and Arrhigi, cleverly wrought up, and giving it, what was
scarcely needed, a more romantic character. It differs
from that here given in many of the circumstances, and in
passing, perhaps, from hand to hand, even the scene has
been transferred to the neighbourhood of Monte Rotondo,
many miles distant from the spot where the events occurred.
My informant was not likely to omit any actual
occurrence of a striking nature; and as he lived at Corte,
and his occupation often led him to the canton of Callacuccia,
he had the best opportunities of learning the facts,
if indeed he was not present at the time. His simple
narrative is therefore adhered to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Leave Corte for Ajaccio.&mdash;A legend of Venaco.&mdash;Arrival
at Vivario.</i></p>


<p>The distance from Corte to Ajaccio is about fifty miles;
the most interesting objects on the road being the great
forest of Vizzavona, and Bocagnono embosomed in chestnut
woods. In order to take these leisurely, mules were
bespoken at Vivario, a mountain village at the foot of
Monte d'Oro, as far as which we determined to avail ourselves
of the <i>diligence</i> passing through Corte, <i>en route</i>
from Bastia to Ajaccio. For the first two stages after
leaving Corte we knew that there was little temptation to
linger on the way; and it is unadvisable to waste time
and strength by walking or riding on high-roads when
coach or rail will hurry you on to a good starting point
for independent rambling. To travel systematically from
one great town to another by such conveyances, with perhaps
an occasional excursion in the neighbourhood, is a
very different affair.</p>

<p>We were called at midnight, and walking to the <i>bureau</i>,
shortly afterwards the <i>voiture</i> came rumbling up, a small
primitive vehicle, drawn by three mules. It contained
five passengers, &ldquo;booked through;&rdquo; three rough fellows,
all smoking, and a woman with a squalling <i>bambino</i>, dignified
by the name of Auguste. Under these circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
we proposed taking our seat on the roof, as there
was no <i>banquette</i>. The <i>commis du bureau</i> objected;&mdash;we
should fall off, and he would be blamed; it was <i>contre les
r&eacute;gles</i>; and every traveller knows how despotically the
rules are administered by foreign officials. He must submit
to be a mere machine in their hands, to be stowed
away and conveyed like his portmanteau. The rules are,
however, generally enforced with great civility; but the
<i>commis</i> was not civil. Early rising, or sitting up late,
had put him out of temper, and the passion into which
he worked himself about this trifle was very amusing.
&ldquo;There was room inside, and why could not <i>messieurs</i>
accommodate themselves in the <i>voiture</i> like sensible
people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We did not lose our temper, and carrying our point,
had every reason to rejoice in our victory. The moon was
up, and showed the sort of scenery through which we
passed, by a very hilly but well-engineered road, to great
advantage, in its various aspects. Now we were slowly
ascending a bare hill-side in the full light; then plunging
into hollows buried in the deepest shade of chestnut woods
branching over the road. Then there were scattered groups
of the rugged ilex, with its pale green leaves silvered by
the moonbeams; and, where the land was cultivated, there
was the livelier green of the young wheat, and the dark
verdure of luxuriant crops of sainfoin: scarcely a house
was passed; a solitary habitation is a rare sight in
Corsica.</p>

<p>Our position also gave us the advantage of the <i>voiturier's</i>
conversation, which, under the inspiration of the scene,
the woods, and moonlight on a lonely road, was well spiced
with stories of banditti. At that corner they stole from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the thicket, and gave their victim a mortal stab. There was
a cross over his grave, but it has been removed. A deadly
shot from behind that grey rock struck down another.
Here they had a bloody fight with the <i>sbirri</i>. Such tales,
as it has been already remarked, are heard everywhere.
I forget the particulars; but they are all variations of one
wild strain, of which the key-note is blood.</p>

<p>One legend of another kind I remember. The <i>voiturier</i>
related it as we approached Venaco:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A long while ago&mdash;it was in the tenth century, I believe&mdash;there
lived here a Count of Corsica, by name Arrhigo
Colonna, who was so handsome that he was called <i>Il Bel
Messere</i>. He had a beautiful wife and seven beautiful
children. Feuds arose in the country, and his enemies,
jealous of his great power, slew the Count and his seven
children, and threw their bodies into a little lake among
the hills. There was deep lamentation among the vassals
of the <i>Bel Messere</i>; and his wife, having escaped, led
them against the assassins, who had taken refuge in a
neighbouring castle, stormed it, and put them all to the
sword. Often are the ghosts of the <i>Bel Messere</i> and his
seven children seen flitting by the pale moonlight&mdash;on such
a night as this&mdash;among the woods and on the green hills of
Venaco; and the shepherds on the mountains all around
preserve the tradition of their sorrowful fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We reached Vivario before daylight, and leaving the
<i>voiture</i>, scrambled up a lane, then some dark stairs, and
found ourselves in the gaunt rooms of a rude <i>locanda</i>.
The people were astir, expecting us, and the best sight
was, not indeed a blazing fire of logs&mdash;though Vivario is
close to the forest, such fires are not to be seen indoors&mdash;but
at least some lighted embers on the cooking-hearth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
giving promise of a speedy cup of hot coffee, for we were
very cold. The mountain air was keen, Vivario standing
nearly 2000 feet above the level of the sea. The best news
was that the mules for our journey were forthcoming.
Meanwhile, we got our wash, and, it being too early to
eat, had our <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i> of bread and wine, grapes and ham,
packed in a basket, to be eaten on the road.</p>

<p>We were objects of much curiosity. Whence did we
come? where were we going? what was our business?&mdash;were
questions of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Sono chiesi in Londra?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Inglesi&mdash;sono tutti Christiani?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may easily be imagined that the communal schools
in Corsica give little instruction in ethnology; and even
intelligent persons, like our former guide Antoine, appeared
to doubt our right to be called Christians. That
was often questioned, the people seeming little better
informed than they were when Boswell travelled in
Corsica, almost a century ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Inglesi</i>,&rdquo; said a strong black fellow to him, &ldquo;<i>sono
barbare; non credono in Dio grande.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; replied Boswell; &ldquo;we do believe in
God, and in Jesus Christ too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Um,</i>&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;<i>e nel Papa?</i>&rdquo; (and in the Pope?)</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>E perche?</i>&rdquo; (And why?)</p>

<p>This was a puzzling question under the circumstances,
for there was a great audience listening to the controversy.
So Boswell thought he would try a method of his own,
and he very gravely replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Perche siamo troppo lontano.</i>&rdquo; (Because we are too far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
off.) A very new argument against the universal infallibility
of the Pope. It took, however; for his opponent
mused awhile, and then said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Troppo lontano! Ha&mdash;Sicilia &egrave; tanto lontano che l'Inghilterra;
e in Sicilia si credono nel Papa.</i>&rdquo; (Too far off!
why Sicily is as far off as England; yet in Sicily they
believe in the Pope.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Boswell, &ldquo;<i>Noi siamo dieci volte pi&ugrave; lontano
che la Sicilia.</i>&rdquo; (We are ten times farther off than Sicily.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Aha!</i>&rdquo; said the questioner; and seemed quite satisfied.
&ldquo;In this manner,&rdquo; concludes Boswell, &ldquo;I got off
very well. I question much whether any of the learned
reasonings of our Protestant divines would have had so
good an effect.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Barbari</i>, <i>heretici</i>, whatever we were, we parted on good
terms with our kind hostess. Two mules were at the
door, attended by a lad, who, at first sight, appeared too
young for the long and rather fatiguing journey before us;
but he had a most intelligent countenance, with hair, eyes,
and features of the true Italian character, and he handled
his mules well, and proved a most active and agreeable
attendant.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight when we wound up a narrow path
to the heights above the village of Vivario, thus saving an
angle of the well-engineered high-road by which the <i>voiture</i>,
preceding us, had gained the summit. Here we
seated ourselves on a bank while my friend sketched. His
view, reproduced in these pages, happily dispenses with
the necessity of any lengthened description. Below, the
eye rested on the tall and graceful <i>campanile</i> of the village
church, with the houses radiating from it, half concealed
by the groves of chestnut-trees embowering the valley.
The slope beneath our point of view, as well as that on
the left under the high-road, was covered by vineyards in
terraces and gardens. The contrast of this verdure with
the bare ridge beyond the fertile basin, still in deep shade,
and the atmospheric effects of a soft and not overpowering
light on the foreground, as well as of the vapour rising in
the gorge, and hanging in a&euml;rial folds about the mountain
tops, can only be imagined.</p>

<p>Smoke now began to curl up from the village hearths,
and men, in rough jackets of black sheep's wool, with axes
slung in their belts, are seen slowly winding up the steep
to their work in the forest. The villages on the tops of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the hills under the mountain ranges, of which we counted
ten or more, reflect the early sunlight. A small fortified
barrack, garrisoned by a party of <i>gendarmes</i>, held in
check the banditti, whose strongest fastnesses were in this
wild neighbourhood, and commands the high-road.</p>

<p>This we now follow; and the views from it are exceedingly
picturesque, the engineers having obtained their level
for it by pursuing the sinuosities of the defiles round
Monte d'Oro, the rival monarch with Monte Rotondo
of the Corsican Alps. Its snowy summit is continually in
sight on our right, and we observe streaks of new-fallen
snow for some distance beneath. On the left, we have
the great forest of Vizzavona, which we shortly entered.
Having before described a Corsican pine-forest of similar
character, repetition would be wearisome. The trees here
are of the same species, with some admixture of oak, many
of them on a scale of equal or greater magnificence. The
finest masts for the French navy have been drawn from
this forest.</p>

<p>Heat and hunger now combined to make us look out for
a rill of water at a convenient spot for taking our <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i>,
and a torrent crossing the road, with a rude bridge over it,
we sat down on the low parapet, and, opening our baskets,
the boy, Filippi, fetched water from the pure stream to
cool and temper our wine. Bread, slices of ham, and
grapes, were rapidly disappearing, when unexpected visitors
appeared on the scene, in the shape of two country girls,
travellers to Ajaccio like ourselves.</p>

<p>We had not been so much struck, to speak the truth,
as some travellers seem to have been with the beauty
and gracefulness of the Corsican women; but these really
were two very pretty girls, of the age of fifteen or sixteen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
brunettes, bright eyed, slightly formed, and with pleasing
and expressive features. They were lightly clad, and one
of them carried a small bundle. Accosted by Filippi, we
learnt that they came from Corte, and were on their way
to Ajaccio, in search of domestic service. Filippi appeared
to know some of their family. To desire the boy to share
with them the meal he was making at some little distance
was only returning Corsican hospitality. The girls were
shy at first, and it was only by degrees that we were able
to establish a chat with them; and I was struck with the
manner in which the eldest, taking a handful of new
chestnuts from a bag, offered the contribution to our pic-nic.
Poor girls! chestnuts and the running brooks were
probably all they had to depend upon for refreshment
during their journey. Happily, both were easily to be
found.</p>

<p>Our road lying the same way, and the girls having
walked from Vivario, while we had been riding, they were
offered a ride on the mules, and, after some hesitation, the
offer was accepted. With Filippi for their squire, the trio
being about the same age, they were a merry party, making
the glades of the old forest ring with their laughter and
the sound of their young voices in the sweetest of tongues.
The girls were in such glee, Filippi pressing the mules to
a gallop, that though we enjoyed the fun, we really feared
they would be thrown off. Our fears were groundless;
riding astride, as is the fashion of the country&mdash;but with
all propriety&mdash;they had a firm seat, and laughed at our
apprehensions.</p>

<p>With all this exuberance of spirits, there were the
greatest modesty and simplicity in the demeanour of
these poor girls. When they proceeded in a more sober<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
mood, we joined in the conversation, asking questions
about their prospects at Ajaccio, and the schooling they
had received. They had no friends at Ajaccio; but the
&ldquo;Mother of Mercy&rdquo; would guide and protect them!</p>

<p>The number of the girls receiving education at the communal
and conventual schools in Corsica is very disproportionate
to that of the boys. Marmocchi states the
number of the former, in 1851 or 1852, as 2362, while the
males receiving public instruction were 14,196. Of the
girls, only 546 are educated in the communal schools, and
1816 in the establishments of the <i>S&#339;urs de St. Joseph</i> or
the <i>Filles de Marie</i>. The proportion of boys frequenting
the Corsican schools, relatively with those of France, is
137 to 100 in the winter, and 226 to 100 in the summer;
but that of the girls is in the inverse, the relative number
being much smaller in Corsica&mdash;12 only to 100 in the
winter, and 21 to 100 in the summer.</p>

<p>Our fellow-travellers were among the favoured number.
Bridget, the eldest, opened her bundle, and took from
among the folds of their slender stock of clothes two little
books, which she showed us with modest pride. They
contained catechisms, the <i>Pater-noster</i>, the <i>Ave Maria</i>,
and a short litany to the Blessed Virgin. Poor girls!
their trust was in Heaven! They had little else to trust
in; but there was a &ldquo;Mother of Mercy&rdquo; to befriend her
loving children. That was the most comfortable article in
their creed&mdash;ideal, but very beautiful.</p>

<p>At the highest point of the <i>Col</i> of Vizzavona, nearly
4000 feet above the level of the sea, we find a loopholed
barrack, surrounded by a ditch, where a small force of the
<i>gendarmerie</i> is stationed to operate against the brigands.
Standing among bare rocks, with the precipices of Monte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
d'Oro frowning above it, the position is most dismal.
Fancy that bleak barrack in the long, dreary winter of
such an elevation, when ice and snow reign over the
whole <i>plateau</i>! And what must have been the severity
of the service when the bleak forest was the hiding-place,
and Bocagnono, just under, the head-quarters, of the most
desperate banditti!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/209.jpg" width="500" height="415" alt="BOCAGNONO." title="BOCAGNONO." />
<p class="caption">BOCAGNONO.</p>
</div>

<p>We still walked on, really preferring it, and glad not
only to give the girls a lift, but to spare the mules, while
carrying their light weight, for the hard service yet before
them. After passing the <i>col</i>, we had a splendid view of
Bocagnono and its hamlets, buried in trees, with bold
mountains beyond. The pines now gave way to beech
woods, and soon afterwards we reached the level of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
chestnut. The fall of the ground became rapid, but, as usual
in such cases, the face of the hill being traversed by stages
of inclined planes, blasted by gunpowder in the rocks, the
gradients of the road were easy.</p>

<p>The chestnut trees in the valley are of extraordinary
size, and a rich <i>contour</i> of growth. Scattered capriciously
among the groves are no less than ten hamlets, all attached
to Bocagnono. It is a wild and romantic neighbourhood;
and the principal village, though surrounded with verdure,
has a most desolate aspect, the houses being built of
unhewn stone, black with age, and the windows unglazed.</p>

<p>Walking down the long, straggling street, noting appearances,
a little in advance of our singular cavalcade, we
observed a very magnificent officer of police, with a cocked
hat and feathers, and sword by his side, sitting on a bench,
smoking his pipe. He scrutinised us closely as we passed,
munching chestnuts, and carelessly throwing the shells
not very far from his worshipful presence. Filippi soon
following with the mules, he was stopped by this important
personage, who questioned him sharply about us. Appearances
were rather against us. The spruce <i>gendarme</i> might
possibly not understand&mdash;and it is often a puzzle&mdash;how
gentlemen in light coats and stout shoes, bronzed, dusty,
and travel-stained, could be walking through the country
quite at their ease. Foreigners make themselves up for
travelling in a very different style. Our juvenile <i>suite</i> also
was somewhat singular, and, altogether, as I have said,
circumstances were suspicious. We might be the last of
the bandits, making their escape to the coast in disguise,
with part of their little family. The orders to arrest such
characters were very strict.</p>

<p>However, it is to be presumed that the official was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
satisfied with Filippi's report, and we escaped a detention
which might have caused us loss of time and patience.
Having cleared the town, we took counsel together. The
day was wearing away, and we were still some thirty miles
from Ajaccio. It was Saturday, and we wished to get to
the end of our journey in order to enjoy a quiet Sunday.
There was nothing on the road to tempt us to linger, and
no probability of finding decent accommodations; while
at Ajaccio, we should be in clover, and get a fresh outfit,
our baggage having been forwarded there. On the other
hand, it was a long pull, and Filippi remonstrated on behalf
of the mules and himself. The first objection was
overruled, and the other removed by our engaging to take
the boy <i>en croupe</i> by turns. Our female attendants we
dismissed with the means of procuring lodgings for the
night; and we relieved Bridget of her burthen, desiring
her to call for it at the hotel at Ajaccio.</p>

<p>Bocagnono stands in the gorge of a long valley, watered
by the Gravone. This river falls into the sea a little south
of Ajaccio, and the road, for the most part following its
course, is generally easy. After leaving Bocagnono, the
valley opened. We were among green hills, with the river
flowing through a rich plain; the Alpine range, from which
we had just descended, making a fine background to this
pleasant landscape. Further on, some very picturesque
villages, perched as usual on heights, increased its interest.</p>

<p>We kept the mules to as sharp a trot as was consistent
with the work still before us. Unfortunately, in the jolting,
poor Bridget's bundle got loose, and the contents being
scattered on the road, the wardrobe of a Corsican girl was
exposed to profane eyes, and it became incumbent on me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
in discharge of my trust, to restore it to order with all possible
neatness and security. Again we pricked on, and
crossing the Gravone at the Ponte d'Usciano, the road
began to ascend, carrying us for some miles over a rugged
spur of the mountains. Here we found ourselves again
among the shrubbery which forms so characteristic a feature
in the landscape of these islands. Having passed the
ruins of a house, the inmates of which, even to the infant
in the cradle, had been butchered in one of the feuds so
common in Corsica, we halted at a roadside <i>albergo</i>, near
a <i>baraque</i> of the <i>gendarmerie</i>. Bread and grapes, with
new wine, were spread for us under the shade of a tree,
and we refreshed ourselves while our mules got their feed
of barley.</p>

<p>We had now nearly a level road all the way to Ajaccio.
The plain was well cultivated, and we remarked some irrigated
fields of maize. Soon afterwards it became dark,
and the mules being much distressed, we could only proceed
at a slow pace. The fatigue of riding was much lessened
by having an English saddle; still it was a hard day's
travelling: but the air was deliciously balmy, and the glowworm's
lamp and cricket's chirp helped to cheer the weariness
of a road which seemed interminable. Presently, we
met country people returning from the market at Ajaccio,
lights were seen more frequently on the hills, and, at last,
the lantern on the pier-head&mdash;a welcome beacon&mdash;came
in view. Half an hour afterwards, we dismounted at an
hotel on the Corso.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

Family.&mdash;Excursion in the Gulf.&mdash;Chapel of the Greeks.&mdash;Evening
Scenes.&mdash;Council-General of the Department.&mdash;Statistics.&mdash;State

<p>Sunday morning we attended high-mass at the cathedral
of Ajaccio, a building of the sixteenth century, in the
Italian style, having a belfry and dome, with the interior
richly decorated. The service was well performed, there
being a fine-toned organ, and the music of the mass well
selected. The congregation was numerous, the girls'
school especially. I was struck with the pensive cast of
features in many of the girls, so like the Madonnas of the
Italian masters. There were formerly six dioceses in Corsica,
Mariana being the principal; for many years they
have been all administered by the Bishop of Ajaccio, who
is at present a suffragan of the Archbishop of Aix, in
France.</p>

<p>After service, we called on one of the professors of the
<i>Coll&egrave;ge-Fesch</i>, to whom we had letters of introduction.
This college and the <i>S&eacute;minaire</i> are the best buildings in
Ajaccio, both being finely situated fronting the sea. The
<i>S&eacute;minaire</i> is confined exclusively to the education of theological
students intended for the clerical orders. In the
other, founded and endowed by Cardinal Fesch, the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of study is that generally pursued in the French colleges.
The cardinal appears to have had more affection for his native
place than any other member of the Bonaparte family,
giving a proof of it in this noble foundation. He also
bequeathed to his native place a large collection of pictures,
few of them, however, of much merit. His remains
are deposited with those of Madame Letizia, his sister, in
a chapel of the cathedral of Ajaccio, having been brought
from Rome; where I recollect seeing him in 1819,&mdash;short
and portly in person, with a mild and good-humoured
expression of countenance. He had been a kind guardian
of the young Bonapartes, and carefully administered the
small property they inherited.</p>

<p>The <i>Coll&egrave;ge-Fesch</i> is a large building, with spacious lecture-rooms,
long and lofty corridors, and a yard for exercise;
the windows of the front looking out on the Gulf of
Ajaccio and the mountains beyond. The professor's apartments
had all the air of the rooms of a college fellow and
tutor in one of our universities, carpets <i>et aliis mutandis</i>;
only they were more airy and spacious. There are fifteen
professors, of whom the Abbate Porazzi is one of the
most distinguished. We were indebted to him for many
good offices during our stay at Ajaccio. The number of
students at this time was 260. They appeared to be of all
ranks and ages; some of them grown men.</p>

<p>Everything here has the southern character. We find
rows of lemon-trees on the Corso; and the cactus, or
Indian fig, flourishes in the environs,&mdash;the bright oleander
thriving in the open air. The heat was excessive, my
thermometer standing at 80&deg; at noon, in the shade of an
airy room. From the Corso, a short street leads into the
market-place, a square, bounded on one side by the port,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and embellished by a fountain. During the last year it
has been further ornamented by a statue of the first Napoleon,
of white marble, standing on a granite pedestal, and
facing the harbour. Concealed during the reigns of the
restored Bourbons, its erection was a homage to the rising
fortunes of the President of the French Republic. Ajaccio,
being the modern capital of Corsica, the <i>chef-lieu</i> of
the department, and seat of the <i>pr&eacute;fetture</i> and administration,
is more French in habits and feeling than any
other town in the island. But even here, I apprehend,
there has never been much enthusiasm for the Bonapartes.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Among the native Corsicans, Pascal Paoli is the national
hero.</p>

<p>We visited, of course, the house in which the first Napoleon
was born, standing in a little solitary court dignified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
with the name of the <i>Piazza Lucrezia</i>, near the market-place.
It has been often described. Uninhabited, and
without a vestige of furniture, except some faded tapestry
on the walls, the desolate and gloomy air of the birthplace
of the great emperor struck me even more than the
deserted apartments at Longwood, from which his spirit
took its flight. There, sheaves of corn and implements of
husbandry still gave signs of human life, singularly as
they contrasted with the relics of imperial grandeur recently
witnessed by the homely apartments. A man, born
in the first year of the French Revolution, and who has
followed the career of its &ldquo;child and champion&rdquo; with the
feelings common to most Englishmen, can have no Napoleonic
sympathies; yet, without forgetting the atrocities,
the selfishness, and the littleness which stained and disfigured
that career, it is impossible that such scenes could
be contemplated by a thoughtful mind, not only without
profound reflection on the vicissitudes of life, but without
a full impression of the genius and force of character
which lifted the Corsican adventurer to the dangerous
height from whence he fell.</p>

<p>One afternoon we hired a boat in the harbour, and sailed
down the Gulf of Ajaccio. This fine inlet, opening to the
south-west, is from three to four leagues in length and
breadth, and forms a basin of about twelve leagues in circumference,
from the northern extremity, where the old
city stood, to its outlet between the <i>Isles Sanguinaires</i> and
the Capo di Moro, on the opposite coast. A range of
mountains, considerably inferior in elevation to the central
chain from which they ramify, rises almost from the shore,
and stretches along the northern side of the gulf. The
other coast is more indented, and swells into the ridges of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the Bastelica, embracing the rich valley of Campo Loro
(<i>Campo del' Oro</i>), washed by the Gravone. The Gulf of
Ajaccio, like many others, has been compared to the Bay
of Naples; but, I think, without much reason, except for
the colouring lent by a brilliant and transparent atmosphere
to both sea and land. In the case of Ajaccio, the
effects are heightened by a still more southern climate, and
the grander scale of the mountain scenery.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/217.jpg" width="500" height="291" alt="HARBOUR OF AJACCIO."
title="HARBOUR OF AJACCIO." />
<p class="caption">HARBOUR OF AJACCIO.</p>
</div>

<p>There were only a few small vessels, employed in the
coasting trade, in the port. We rowed round the mole,
under the frowning bastions of the citadel, a regular work
covering a point stretching into the bay; and then hoisting
sail, stood out into the gulf. The wind was too light
to admit of our gaining its entrance; we sailed down it,
however, for four or five miles in the mid-channel, the
rocky islands at the northern entrance gradually opening;
one crowned with the tower of a lighthouse, another with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
a village on its summit. The coast to our right was clothed
with the deep verdure of the ever memorable Corsican
shrubbery, breathing aromatic odours as we drifted along:
otherwise, it appeared desolate; not a village appeared,
and the barren and rugged mountain chain towered above.</p>

<p>Finding that we made but little progress, the boat was
steered for a little reef of rocks on the northern shore,
and landing, we dismissed the boatman, determining to
walk back to Ajaccio along the water's edge. Meanwhile
we sat down on the rocks while my companion sketched.
Presently I strolled up to a little chapel, standing by the
side of the road which winds round the gulf towards <i>les
Isles Sanguinaires</i>. A simple and chaste style of Italian architecture
distinguished the white <i>fa&ccedil;ade</i>, rising gracefully
to a pediment, crowned with a cross; pilasters, supporting
arches, divided the portico beneath into three compartments,
the central one forming the entrance. The door was
closed, but the interior was visible through a <i>grille</i> at
the side. The nave was paved with blue and white squares,
and marble steps led up to the sanctuary, forming, with
two side chapels, a Greek cross. There was no ornament,
no furniture, except two or three low chairs for kneeling.
Under the portico was a marble tablet, inscribed in good
Latin, to the pious memory of a Pozzo di Borgo<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, who
restored the chapel in 1632. I read on another tablet:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<i>&ldquo;Per gli Orfanelli dei Marinari Naufragati.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p>Under an arch supported by pillars of green marble, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
lamp was feebly glimmering, fed perhaps by the offerings
of loving mothers and fond wives who here offered their
vows for the safe return of those dear to them.</p>

<p>The sun was setting behind the islands at the mouth of
the gulf, perfect stillness reigned, broken only by a gentle
ripple on the granite rocks forming ledges from the water's
edge to the base of the chapel. Struck with its singular
interest, and wishing to learn more about it, on returning
to my friend, who was still sketching, I found him in conversation
with some loungers from the town. They could
only tell us that it was called &ldquo;The Chapel of the Greeks,&rdquo;
and, laughing, turned on their heels when I pursued my
inquiries. Did they suppose that we Northerns had no
sentiment in our religion, or had they none themselves?
I afterwards heard two traditions respecting the Chapel of
the Greeks. One, that it was founded by the remains of a
colony from the Morea, who, having been expelled with
great loss from their settlement at Cargese, were granted
an asylum here;&mdash;the other, that the original building
was erected, by Greek mariners, in acknowledgment of
their escape from shipwreck on this coast.</p>

<p>It would be difficult, I imagine, to find a more favourable
point of view, or a happier moment, than that of which
my friend availed himself to make the sketch of Ajaccio,
which has been selected for the frontispiece of this volume.
The gulf was perfectly calm, and of the deepest green and
azure, a slight ripple being only discernible where a boat
lay in one of the long streams of light reflected from the
mass of orange and golden clouds in which the sun was
setting behind the islands; while, to the east, flakes of rosy
hue floated in the mid-heaven. The sails of the feluccas,
becalmed in the gulf, faintly caught the light, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
gleamed on the houses of Ajaccio, particularly those of the
modern town, distinguished by its white walls and red
roofs from the old buildings about the cathedral. Behind
were sugar-loaf hills; and the mountain-sides across the
gulf glowed with the richest purple. Then came gradual
changes of colour, softer and deeper hues, till, at last, a
steamy veil of mist from seaward stole over the gulf. A
faint glimmer from the lighthouse at the entrance of the
harbour was scarcely visible in the blaze left behind by the
glorious sunset.</p>

<p>The lights began to twinkle from the windows of Ajaccio,
and the cathedral bells tolling for the Ave Maria, stole on
the ear across the gulf in the silence of the twilight hour.
Reluctant to leave the scene, we lingered till it was
shrouded from view, and an evening never to be forgotten
closed in. Then we wound slowly towards the city along
the shore, at the foot of hills laid out in vineyards hedged
by the prickly cactus, or lightly sprinkled with myrtles
and cystus, and all those odoriferous plants which now
perfumed the balmy night air. Embowered in these, we
had remarked some mortuary chapels, the burying-places
of Ajaccian families. One of them, high up on the hill-side,
was in the form of a Grecian temple; and we now
passed another, standing among cypresses, close to the
shore. Nearer the city, two stone pillars stand at the entrance
of an avenue leading up to a dilapidated country-house,
formerly the residence of Cardinal Fesch, and where
Madame Bonaparte and her family generally spent the
summer. Among the neglected shrubberies, and surrounded
by the wild olive, the cactus, the clematis, and
the almond, is a singular and isolated granite rock, called
Napoleon's grotto, once his favourite retreat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>On our return, we found the streets thronged; braziers
with roasted chestnuts stood at every corner; strings of
mules, loaded with wine casks suspended on each side,
were returning from the vineyards; and there was a gay
promenade on the Corso&mdash;ladies with no covering for
their heads but the graceful black <i>faldetta</i>, French officers
in not very brilliant uniforms, and a sprinkling of ecclesiastics
in <i>soutanes</i> and prodigious beavers.</p>

<p>Professor Porazzi took us to the only bookseller's shop
in Ajaccio, where we made some purchases. It was a
small affair, the book trade being combined with the sale
of a variety of miscellaneous articles. The <i>pr&eacute;fetture</i>, a
handsome building, lately finished, contains a library of
25,000 volumes. We were introduced there to M. Camille
Friess, the author of a compendious history of Corsica,
who was kind enough to show us some of the archives, of
which he has the custody. Among the documents connected
with the Bonaparte family is a memorial, addressed
by Napoleon to the Intendant of Corsica, respecting his
mother's right to a garden. I jotted down the beginning
and end:&mdash;</p>

<p>The claim for a few roods of nursery garden was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
by a young man who afterwards distributed kingdoms and
principalities! It is said that in the division of some property
which fell to the family after he became emperor,
his share was an olive-yard in the environs of Ajaccio.</p>

<p>M. Friess obligingly gave me copies of the <i>proc&egrave;s-verbals</i>
of the proceedings of the Council-General of the
Department for the preceding years. These reports are
printed annually, and, I believe, similar ones are made in
all the departments of France. Those I possess are models
of good arrangement in whatever concerns provincial administration.
They have supplied more information on
the present state of Corsica and its prospects of improvement
than all the books of travel, and works of greater
pretensions, it has been my fortune to meet with.</p>

<p>The Council-General, as many of my readers know, is a
body elected by the people; each canton, of which there are
sixty-one in Corsica, sending representatives in proportion
to the population. The <i>pr&eacute;fet</i>, who is <i>ex-officio</i> president,
opens the session by a speech, in which he reviews the
affairs of the department under the heads of finance, public
works, education, &amp;c., &amp;c., and presents a budget, with
detailed reports on the various branches of administration.
All these are printed, with a short <i>proc&egrave;s-verbal</i> of the debates,
and the divisions when the Council-General comes
to a vote. The proceedings are submitted to the Minister
of the Interior, who approves or rejects the proposals made.
Virtually, however, although the Council has no power to
act on its resolutions until they are confirmed by the central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
government, whatever relates to the assessment of
taxes, police, roads, and other works, all matters of local
interest not only come under discussion in these provincial
assemblies, but are shaped and decided by them. The services
thus rendered must therefore be very valuable, and
it is worth considering whether our over-worked House of
Commons might not be relieved of some of its burthens,
and the business better done, by similar representative
bodies, entrusted with legislative powers so far as concerns
matters of local interest. Such assemblies would well
accord with our Anglo-Saxon institutions. But to give
them a fair field, with sufficient weight, impartiality, and
importance, a considerable area should be embraced in each
jurisdiction. Durham might be united with Yorkshire;
the three western counties, Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall,
might form a province; North and South Wales,
each one. And what a valuable body of statistics would
be furnished by an annual report, corresponding with
those which have led to these remarks!</p>

<p>We gather some general statistics from these documents
and other sources.</p>

<p>By the census of 1851, the population of Corsica was
236,251 souls, of whom 117,938 were males, and 118,313
females. All but 54 were Roman Catholics. There were
no less than 32,364 proprietors of land. The day-labourers
were 34,427; government officials, 1229; clergy, 955; regular
troops, <i>gendarmes</i>, &amp;c., 5000. The number of students
in all the public colleges and schools was from 16,000 to
17,000, of which 15,000 were male, and only from 2000 to
3000 females. The proportion of males frequenting the
schools is greater than in France, it being as 137 to 100 in
the winter, and 226 to 100 in the summer; while that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the girls is the reverse, being as 12 to 100 in the winter,
and 21 to 100 in the summer. This disproportion between
male and female scholars in Corsica is very remarkable.</p>

<p>The superficies of the island is estimated at somewhat
less than two millions and a quarter of English acres. Of
this surface, only a six-hundredth part is, on an average,
under cultivation, an area which, it is said, might be
doubled. Vast portions of the soil belong to the communes,
and measures are in contemplation for their improvement.</p>

<p>Wheat produces, on an average of years, an increase
of nine times the seed sown; barley and oats, twelve or
thirteen; maize, thirty-eight to forty; and potatoes,
twenty.</p>

<p>The rate of daily wages for the year 1851 was fixed by
the Council-General at 75 <i>centimes</i> for the towns of Ajaccio
and Bastia, and 50 <i>centimes</i> for all the other communes.</p>

<p>Among the most important subjects brought to notice
by the <i>proc&egrave;s-verbal</i> of 1851 is the state of agriculture in
the island; on which the <i>Pr&eacute;fet</i> finds little to congratulate
the Council-General except an increase in the cultivation
of lucerne and in the plantations of mulberry-trees. The
obstacles to its progress are found in the insecurity of life,
the want of inclosures, and the unbounded rights of common
enjoyed by the shepherds; in the richest plains being
uninhabited, and their distance from the villages; in the
pestilential air of these plains, and the want of roads.&mdash;A
stranger will be disposed to add to this list the indolence
of the natives. So far as the obstacles to improvement
can be surmounted by judicious legislation and encouragement,
the <i>proc&egrave;s-verbals</i> of the Council-General exhibit
enlightened ideas far in advance of the opinions and habits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of the people; and there is much good sense and right
feeling in the observation with which the <i>Pr&egrave;fet</i>, in one of
his addresses, concludes his statement of the position of
affairs:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Si la Corse,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;devait passer subitement &agrave;
l'&eacute;tat des civilisations avanc&eacute;es, elle courait risque de
perdre dans cette transformation (et ce serait &agrave; jamais
deplorable) tout ce qu'il y a de primitif, de g&eacute;n&eacute;reux,
d'&eacute;nergetique dans ses m&#339;urs s&eacute;culaires. Je n'en citerai
qu'un exemple. Le mouvement civilisateur trouve, &agrave;
certains &eacute;gards, r&eacute;sistance dans la force des sentiments de
famille, dans la coh&eacute;sion des membres qui la composent.
Et, cependant, qui d'entre vous consentirait &agrave; acheter les
progr&egrave;s de la civilisation au prix du r&eacute;l&acirc;chement de ces
liens sacr&eacute;s qui sont la clef de vo&ucirc;te de toute soci&eacute;t&eacute;
organis&eacute;e?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Delivered from the scourge of <i>banditisme</i> and the <i>vendetta</i>
by severe measures, supposed to be strongly opposed
to the popular instinct, and with hopes held out of such
further improvement in civilisation as the progress of ideas
will admit, Corsica may, perhaps, have no reason to regret
that she failed in her long struggles for national independence.
But France will not have performed her duty to
this outlying department of the empire till she promotes
the manufactures and commerce of the island. It is a part
of the protective system to which she clings to discourage
all direct foreign trade, just as England formerly engrossed
the commerce of her colonies. The result is that the poor
Corsicans, compelled to purchase the commodities they
require&mdash;manufactured goods, colonial produce, and even
corn and cattle&mdash;in the French market, buy at enormously
high prices. The balance of trade is much against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
them, their annual exports to France being only a million
and a half of <i>francs</i>, while they import from thence articles
of the value of three millions. The present Emperor of
France is understood to entertain enlightened views on
the subject of free trade; and it is to be hoped that,
when he is able to carry them out, Corsica will share in
the benefits of an unrestricted commerce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

Brothers&rdquo; laid there&mdash;Quarrel of the Vincenti and Grimaldi.&mdash;Road
to Sartene.&mdash;Corsican Marbles.&mdash;Arrive at
Bonifacio</i>.</p>


<p>We were quite as well served, and the accommodations
were as good, at Ajaccio as in any provincial city of France.
They gave us a delicate white wine made in the neighbourhood,
an agreeable beverage, which, we thought, resembled
<i>Chablais</i>; and a <i>confiture</i> of cherries preserved in jelly,
which was exquisite. I had told the story of our adventure
with the poor girls from Corte to the mistress of the
house, and, on Bridget's appearing the day after our arrival
to claim her wardrobe, she informed me, with great joy, that
our good hostess had taken her into her service.</p>

<p>On leaving Ajaccio, Sartene was our next point. The
road crosses the Gravone and the Prunelle, flowing into
the gulf through fertile valleys, and then winds through a
wild and mountainous country, in which Cauro is the only
village, till, surmounting the Col San Georgio, 2000 feet
above the level of the sea, it descends into a rich plain,
watered by the Taravo. In its upper course its branches
water two romantic valleys, which formed the ancient fiefs
of Ornano and Istria, the seats of powerful lords in the old
times. Picturesque scenery, ruins of castles, and medi&aelig;val<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
tales lend a charm to this region, in which we would
gladly have wandered for some days, but that Sardinia
was before us.</p>

<p>There are few finer spots in the island than the <i>paese</i> of
Olmeto, the principal village being surrounded by mountains,
with a plain below, extending to the deep inlet of
the Mediterranean, called the Gulf of Valinco, and rich in
corn-lands, olive, and fruit trees. At Olmeto we were
served with a dish of magnificent apples, some of them
said to weigh two pounds. On the Monte Buturetto, 3000
feet high, are seen the ruins of the stronghold of Arrigo
della Rocca; and, further on, near Sollacar&oacute;, another almost
inaccessible summit was crowned by a castle, built by his
nephew, Vincentello d'Istria&mdash;both famed in Corsican
story.</p>

<p>It was at Sollacar&oacute;, standing at the foot of this hill,
that our countryman, Boswell, first presented himself
to Pascal Paoli, in a house of the Colonna's, with letters
of introduction from the Count de Rivarola and
Rousseau. Boswell remained some time with Paoli,
who was then keeping a sort of court at Sollacar&oacute;,
and admitted him to the most familiar intercourse. His
conversations with the illustrious Corsican, jotted down in
his own peculiar style, form the most interesting part of
the account of his tour, published after his return to
England. &ldquo;From my first setting out on this tour,&rdquo; he
states, &ldquo;I wrote down every night what I had observed
during the day. Of these particulars the most valuable to
my readers, as well as to myself, must surely be the
memoirs and remarkable sayings of Pascal Paoli, which I
am proud to record.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>
<p>Boswell was treated with much distinction, and appears
to have been flattered with the character, which ignorance
or policy attributed to him, of being <i>Il Ambasciadore Inglese</i>.
&ldquo;In the morning,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I had my chocolate
served up on a silver salver, adorned with the arms of Corsica.
I dined and supped constantly with the general. I
was visited by all the nobility; and when I chose to make
a little tour, I was attended by a party of guards. One
day, when I rode out, I was mounted on Paoli's own
horse, with rich furniture of crimson velvet and broad
gold lace, and had my guards marching along with me.&rdquo;
His vanity so flattered, and with what he calls Attic evenings,
&ldquo;<i>noctes, c&#339;n&aelig;que De&ucirc;m</i>,&rdquo; giving scope to his ruling
passion, James Boswell must have been in the seventh
heaven while Paoli's guest at Sollacar&oacute;.</p>

<p>But the most amusing part of the affair is the efforts he
made to ingratiate himself with the lower classes of the
Corsicans, his admiration of whom is sometimes chequered
by a wholesome fear of their wild instincts. &ldquo;I got a
Corsican dress made,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;in which I walked about
with an air of true satisfaction. The general did me the
honour to present me with his own pistols, made in the
island, all of Corsican wood and iron, and of excellent
workmanship. I had every other accoutrement.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The
peasants and soldiers became quite free and easy with me.
One day, they would needs hear me play upon my German
flute. I gave them one or two Italian airs, and then some
of our beautiful old Scotch tunes&mdash;&#8216;Gilderoy,&#8217; &#8216;The Lass
of Patie's Mill,&#8217; &#8216;Corn-riggs are bonny.&#8217; The pathetic
simplicity and pastoral gaiety of the Scotch music will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
always please those who have the genuine feelings of nature.
The Corsicans were charmed with the specimens I
gave them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good friends insisted also on having an English
song from me. I endeavoured to please them in this, too,
and was very lucky in what occurred to me. I sung to
them &#8216;Hearts of oak are our ships; hearts of oak are our
men.&#8217; I translated it into Italian for them; and never
did I see men so delighted with a song as the Corsicans
were with &#8216;Hearts of Oak.&#8217; &#8216;<i>Cuore di querco</i>,&#8217; cried they,
&#8216;<i>bravo Inglese!</i>&#8217; It was quite a joyous riot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Boswell's correspondence during this tour is also characteristic.
He informs us that he walked one day to Corte,
from the convent where he lodged, purposely to write
a letter to Mr. Samuel Johnson.&mdash;&ldquo;I told my revered
friend, that from a kind of superstition, agreeable in a
certain degree to him as well as to myself, I had, during
my travels, written to him from <span class="smcap">Loca Solemnia</span>, places in
some measure sacred. That, as I had written to him from
the tomb of Melancthon, sacred to learning and piety, I
now wrote to him from the palace of Pascal Paoli, sacred
to wisdom and liberty; knowing that, however his political
principles may have been represented, he had always a
generous zeal for the common rights of humanity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Johnson was pleased with what I wrote here; for
I received, at Paris, an answer from him, which I keep as
a valuable charter. &#8216;When you return, you will return to
an unaltered and, I hope, unalterable friend. All that you
have to fear from me is the vexation of disappointing me.
No man loves to frustrate expectations which have been
formed in his favour, and the pleasure which I promise
myself from your journals and remarks is so great, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
perhaps no degree of attention or discernment will be able
to afford it. Come home, however, and take your chance.
I long to see you and to hear you; and hope that we shall
not be so long separated again. Come home, and expect
such a welcome as is due to him whom a wise and noble
curiosity has led where, perhaps, no native of this country
ever was before.&#8217;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>We have a certain sympathy for Boswell. He was the
first Englishman on record who penetrated into Corsica,
and none but ourselves, as far as we have any account,
have followed his steps for nearly a century. Not to
weary the reader, we have done him injustice in only
making extracts from his work betraying the weak points
of his character; for his account of Corsica is valuable for
its research, its descriptions, and its history of the times.
His <i>memorabilia</i> of Pascal Paoli supply ample materials for
any modern Plutarch who would contrast his character
with that of his rival countryman, Napoleon Bonaparte.
Commencing their political career in unison, widely as it
diverged, both ended their lives in exile on British soil.
Though Paoli's sphere was narrow, so was that of some of
the greatest men in Grecian history; and, like theirs, it
had far extended relations. The eyes of Europe were upon
him; Corsica was then its battle-field, and the principles
of his conduct and administration are of universal application.</p>

<p>But Sollacar&oacute; may have more interest for the public of
the present day from its connection with a romance of
Alexandre Dumas, and the play founded upon it, than
from Paoli's having held court, or Boswell's visit to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
there. We have traced the wizard's footsteps, in one
of his works of genius, at the Ch&acirc;teau d'If and Monte
Cristo<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>, we meet them again in the wilds of Corsica. Few
of my readers can follow us there; but let them go to the
&ldquo;Princess's&rdquo; when &ldquo;The Corsican Brothers&rdquo; is performed,
and they will realise much that we have told them of the
Corsican temperament and Corsican life. How true to
nature is the reply of Fabian, in the first act, to the suggestion
of his friend, &ldquo;Then you will never leave the
village of Sollacar&oacute;?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It seems strange to you that a
man should cling to such a miserable country as Corsica;
but what else can you expect? I am one of those plants
that will only live in the open air. I must breathe an
atmosphere impregnated with the life-giving emanations
of the mountains and the sharp breezes of the sea. I
must have my torrents to cross, my rocks to climb, my
forests to explore. I must have my carbine, room, independence,
and liberty. If I were transported into a city,
methinks I should be stifled, as if I were in a prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scene of the first act is laid in an old mansion of the
Colonna's at Sollacar&oacute;, perhaps that in which Boswell
lodged. The action turns upon an antient feud between the
Orlandi and Colonne, which is with difficulty extinguished
by the intervention of Fabian, one of the Corsican brothers.
A short dialogue tells the story:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fabian.</span> &#8216;You come among us to witness a <i>vendetta</i>;
well! you will behold something much more rare&mdash;you
will be present at a reconciliation.&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Alfred.</span> &#8216;A reconciliation?&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fab.</span> &#8216;Which will be no easy matter, I assure you,
considering the point to which things are come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Alf.</span> &#8216;And from what did this great quarrel originate,
which, thanks to you, is on the eve of being extinguished?&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fab.</span> &#8216;Why, I confess I feel some difficulty in telling
you that. The first cause was&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Alf.</span> &#8216;Was what?&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fab.</span> &#8216;The first cause was a hen.&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Alf.</span> (<i>astonished</i>) &#8216;A hen!&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fab.</span> &#8216;Yes. About ten years ago, a hen escaped from
the poultry-yard of the Orlandi, and took refuge in that of
one of the Colonne. The Orlandi claimed the hen. The
Colonne maintained it was theirs. In the heat of the discussion,
an Orlando was imprudent enough to threaten
that he would summon the Colonne before the <i>Juge de
Paix</i>, and put them on their oath. At this menace, an
old woman of the Colonna family, who held the hen in
her hand, twisted its neck, and threw it in the face of the
mother of Orlando. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if the hen be
thine, eat it!&rdquo; Upon this, an Orlando picked up the
hen by the claws, and raised his hand, with the hen in it,
to strike her who had thrown it in the face of his mother;
but at the moment he lifted his hand, a Colonna, who unfortunately
had his loaded carbine with him, without hesitation,
fired, and shot him in the breast, and killed him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Alf.</span> &#8216;Good heavens! And how many lives has this
ridiculous squabble cost?&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fab.</span> &#8216;There have been nine persons killed and five
wounded.&#8217;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Alf.</span> &#8216;What! and all for a miserable hen?&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fab.</span> &#8216;Yes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Alf.</span> &#8216;And it is, doubtless, in compliance with the
prayers of one of these two families that you have interfered
to terminate this quarrel?&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fab.</span> &#8216;Oh! not at all. They would have exterminated
one another to the very last man rather than have
made a single step towards each other. No, no; it is at
the entreaty of my brother.&#8217;&rdquo; ...</p>

<p>The action of this scene consists in the formal but unwilling
reconciliation of the two clans, represented by their
chiefs, in the presence of a <i>juge de paix</i>; in token of which
a hen was to be presented by the Orlando to the Colonna.
The situation affords scope for ludicrous disputes whether it
should be a white hen or a black one&mdash;dead or alive&mdash;which
should hold out his hand first, and so on; mixed with the
more serious question, whether they met on equal terms,
only four Orlandi having been slain against five Colonne,
but four Orlandi wounded to one Colonna&mdash;the Colonne
&ldquo;counting the wounded for nothing,&rdquo; if they did not die
of their wounds.</p>

<p>The main plot is beside our purpose. The scene changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
to Paris, and the catastrophe may be imagined from the
words of Fabian in the last act, which give, alas! too true
a picture of what the social state of Corsica was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8216;A Corsican family is the ancient hydra, one of whose
heads has no sooner been cut off than there springs forth
another, which bites and tears in the place of the one that
has been severed from the trunk. What is my will, sir?
My will is to kill him who has killed my brother!&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8216;You are determined to kill me, sir! How?&#8217;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fab.</span> &#8216;Oh, be satisfied! Not from behind a wall, not
through a hedge, as is the mode in my country, as is the
practice there; but, as it is done here, <i>&agrave; la mode Fran&ccedil;aise</i>,
with a frilled shirt and white gloves;&mdash;and you see, sir, I
am in fighting costume.&#8217;&rdquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But we must return to our Rambles, trusting to the indulgent
reader's forgiveness, if our pen sometimes rambles too.
On leaving Olmeto, the road skirts the Gulf of Valinco,
and, after touching the little port of Propriano, ascends to
Sartene. This town, the seat of one of the five <i>sous-pr&eacute;fettures</i>
into which the island is divided, stands on the
summit of a hill, the plain below being covered with olive-yards
and fruit-trees, with vineyards on the slopes, and
groves of ilex further up. The place has a melancholy
aspect, all the houses being of the rudest construction,
built of unhewn granite, black with age, and very lofty.
It is divided into two quarters; one inhabited by wealthy
families, among which, we were told, there are fifteen
worth 200,000 <i>francs</i> each; and the other by the lower
class of people, a turbulent race, between whom and the
patricians there have long been bloody feuds, breaking out
into open war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The country between Sartene and Bonifacio is wild and
mountainous; and the road winding along the sides of the
hills, many fine points of view are presented. To the
northward, the eye rested on the lofty peak of Monte
Incudine, and the long ridge of the Cascione, the high
pasturages of which are occupied during the summer
months by the shepherds of Quenza and other villages of
the Serra. Southward, we have the coast, deeply indented,
the blue Mediterranean, and, at about two hours from
Sartene, the distant mountains of Sardinia, in faint outline.
Now, there is in sight the grey tower of one of the
old feudal castles, overgrown with wood, and rising among
pinnacles of rock; vast forests clothe some of the mountain-sides,
and everywhere we find the arbutus, the myrtle,
and evergreen shrubbery. Here it contrasts well with the
red and grey rocks we see around. That reddish rock is a
compact granite, evidently admitting of a high polish.
There are quarries by the side of the road, which is cut
through it; and we are informed that it is sent to Rome
for works of art.</p>

<p>Corsica is rich in valuable marbles, as yet turned to
little account. Not far from Olmeto, in this route, in the
canton of Santa Lucia, is found a beautiful granite, peculiar
to the island. They call it <i>orbicularis</i>. It has a blueish
cast, with white and black spots. I have observed it among
the choice specimens with which the chapel of the Medici,
at Florence, is so richly inlaid. The Corsican mountains
present a variety of other fine granites, with porphyry and
serpentine, in some of which agates and jaspers are incorporated.
Of marbles proper, there are quarries in the
island of a statuary marble, of a pure and dazzling whiteness,
said to be equal to the best Carrara. Blocks of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
from five to eight feet thick, can be obtained from a single
layer. Blueish-grey and pale yellow marbles are found
near Corte and Bastia. But of metalliferous rocks and
deposits the island cannot boast; a few iron mines, that of
Olmeta in particular, one of copper, another of antimony,
and one of manganese, form the scanty catalogue. It
is to the island of Elba that we must look for mineral
wealth.</p>

<p>Connected with the mineralogy of Corsica, I would just
mention, in passing, that the island abounds in warm, sulphureous,
and chalybeate springs, some of them strongly
impregnated with carbonic acid gas. Those of Orezza,
Puzzichello, and the Fiumorbo, are in great repute; and I
collect from the <i>proc&egrave;s-verbals</i> of the Council-General, that
the mineral waters of Corsica are considered objects of
much importance, considerable sums being annually voted
for making baths, with roads to them, and encouraging
parties engaged in opening them to the public.</p>

<p>Descending from the heights, after halting at a solitary
post-house, we cross a large tract of partially-cultivated
flats, through which the Ortolo flows sluggishly into the
Gulf of Roccapina. Again we climb a ridge, and the
mountains of Sardinia rise distinctly before us over the
straits and islands beneath us. The road now approaches
the Mediterranean, crossing the heads of the small Gulfs of
Figari and Ventiligni. Many streams flow into them
through a country uninhabited, and said to be unhealthy.</p>

<p>Some miles succeed of the undulating shrubbery of the
<i>maquis</i>, over a poor and rugged surface, till we surmount
the last ridge, and, suddenly, Bonifacio appears across the
harbour, crowning a rocky peninsula rising boldly from
the sea, which washes almost the whole circuit of its base.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
The chalk cliffs are of a dazzling whiteness, and scooped
out by the action of the waves and the weather into the
most fantastic shapes. Their entire <i>enceinte</i> is surrounded
by fortifications, screening from sight most of the town;
the church domes, with watch-towers and a massive citadel,
alone breaking the picturesque outline. At the foot of
the road, along the harbour-side, lies the <i>Marino</i>, inhabited
by fishermen, and the seat of a small coasting trade
and some commerce across the straits with the island of
Sardinia.</p>

</div>

<p>To this Marino we rumble down the steep bank on the
opposite side of the creek, through ilex woods festooned
with wild vines, and, lower down, through olive groves.
We travelled in the <i>coup&eacute;</i> of the <i>diligence</i> from Sartene
with a young Corsican officer in the French service, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
had come on leave from Dieppe to bid farewell to his
family at Bonifacio, expecting to be employed in the expedition
to the East. We talked of the coming war, with
an almost impregnable fortress before us, memorable for
its obstinate resistance to sieges, as remarkable in old times
as that in which both, probably, of my fellow-travellers
were, twelve months afterwards, engaged. On approaching
the place, we witnessed a scene which gave us some idea of
the warmth of family feeling among the Corsicans. At
the foot of the descent, a mile from the town, the <i>diligence</i>
suddenly stopped. By the road-side a group, of all ages
and both sexes, was waiting its arrival. What fond greetings!
what tender embraces! A young urchin seized his
brother's sword, almost as long as himself; the mother and
sisters clung to his side. Leaving him to walk to the town
thus happily escorted, we are set down on the quay. The
only access to the town itself is by a steep inclined plane,
with slopes and steps cut in the rock. No wheel carriage
ever enters the place. We pass under a gloomy arch in
the barbican, surmounted by a strong tower, and establish
ourselves in a very unpromising <i>locanda</i>, after vainly
searching for better quarters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>Boniface, Marquis of Tuscany, one of the noblest and
bravest of Charlemagne's peers, was entrusted by his feeble
successor with the defence of the most salient point in the
southern frontier of his dominions against the incessant
ravages of the Saracen Corsairs from Barbary and Spain.
Created Count of Corsica, Boniface founded, in 830, the
strong fortress, on the southern extremity of the island,
which bears his name. A massive round tower, called <i>Il
Torrione</i>, the original citadel, still proudly crowns the
heights, having withstood for ages the storms of war and
the tempests which lash its exposed and sea-girt site.
Three other ancient towers, including the barbican already
mentioned, strengthened the position; and others, with
ramparts, curtains, and bastions, were added to the works
in succeeding times, till the whole circuit of the rocky
<i>plateau</i> bristles with defensive works. Within these the
town is closely packed in narrow streets;&mdash;but of that
hereafter.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Of its history it need only be mentioned, that after
passing to the Pisans, the Genoese got possession of the
place by a stratagem, and it remained for many centuries
under their protection, but enjoying great independent
privileges. Genoese families of distinction settled there,
and, during the wars with the Corsicans and their allies,
Bonifacio steadfastly adhered to the fortunes of the Republic.</p>

<p>In the course of these wars, the place sustained two
sieges, so signalised by the vigour and obstinacy of the
attack and defence, especially by the heroic resistance of
the Bonifacians and the extremity of suffering they endured,
that these sieges are memorable amongst the most
famous of either ancient or modern times.</p>

<p>In 1420, Alfonso of Arragon, having pretensions on Corsica,
invested Bonifacio by sea and land with a powerful
force, supported by his partisan, Vincintello d'Istria, at
the head of his Corsican vassals. The siege, which lasted
five months, was vigorously pressed on the part of the
Spaniards, and met by a defence equally determined.
Night and day, a terrible shower of stone balls and other
missiles was hurled at the walls and into the town by the
besiegers' engines, both from the fleet and the position
occupied by the king's army on a neighbouring hill. The
besiegers also threw arrows from the ships' towers and
round-tops, and leaden acorns from certain hand-bombards,
of cast metal, hollow, like a reed, as they are described by
the Corsican historian, these leaden acorns being propelled
by fire, and piercing through a man in armour. Artillery,
the great arm in modern sieges, thus helped to sweep the
ranks of the devoted Bonifacians. Seventy years before,
it had been employed, in a rude shape, by the English at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the battle of Cr&eacute;ci. The walls and towers crumbled under
the storm of heavier missiles discharged by the machines
of ancient warfare, and the houses were laid in ruins.
Twice, practicable breaches were effected, and the Spaniards,
bravely mounting to the assault, which lasted
several days, were repulsed with severe loss; the women of
Bonifacio, as well as the priests and monks, vyeing with the
townsmen in heroic courage while defending the breaches.
Then, both sexes and every age worked night and day in
throwing up barricades and repairing the walls.</p>

<p>In the face of this obstinate defence, Alfonso, despairing
of being able to carry the place by assault, determined on
forcing the enemy to surrender from starvation, during a
protracted siege; and, still pouring missiles incessantly into
the place, he maintained a close blockade by sea and land,
drawing chains across the harbour to prevent supplies
being thrown in. The corn magazine had been burnt;
and the besieged, reduced to the last extremity, were compelled
to devour the most loathsome herbs and animals.
Many, wounded and helpless, would have been carried off
by hunger had not the compassion of the women afforded
them relief; for the kind-hearted women of Bonifacio, we
are told, actually offered their breasts to their brothers,
children, blood-relations, and sponsors; and there was no
one during the terrible siege of Bonifacio who had not
sucked the breast of a woman. They even, it is said,
made a cheese of their milk, and sent it to the king, as
well as threw bread from the walls, to disguise their state
of distress from the Spaniards.</p>

<p>The republic of Genoa, receiving intelligence of the
extremity to which its faithful town was reduced, lost no
time in fitting out a fleet to convey to its aid a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
reinforcement, with supplies of arms and food; but the
season was so stormy that for three months, between September
and January (1421), the expedition was detained
in the harbour of Genoa.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the townsmen, almost in despair, listened to
the honourable terms offered by the King of Arragon, and
at last agreed to capitulate if no relief arrived within
forty days. But the king refusing to allow them to send
messengers to Genoa, they hastily built a small vessel,
and lowering it by ropes from the rock, then let down the
devoted crew, who, at every peril, were to convey the
magistrates' letters to the senate of Genoa. Followed to
the point of rock by multitudes of the citizens, the women,
it is said, by turns offered them their breasts: food there
was little or none to take with them.</p>

<p>After fifteen days of terrible suspense, during which the
churches were open from early morning till late at night,
the people praying for deliverance from their enemies and
for forgiveness of their sins, and going in procession, barefoot,
though the winter was severe, from the cathedral of
St. Mary to St. Dominic and the other churches, chanting
litanies;&mdash;at last, when hopes were failing, the little vessel
crept under the rock by night, and the crew, giving the signal
and being drawn up by ropes, brought the joyful news to the
anxious crowd that the Genoese fleet was close at hand.
The period for the surrender was come, when sorrow was
turned to joy. The bells pealed, fire signals were lighted
on all the towers, and shouts of exultation rose to heaven.
The Arragonese thundered at the gates, demanding the
surrender, for the relieving fleet was not yet descried. The
Bonifacians asserted that relief had arrived in the night;
and, to countenance the assertion, there appeared bands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
armed men, who marched round the battlements, with
glittering lances and armour, and the standard of Genoa
at their head; for the women of Bonifacio had put on
armour, so that, like the female peasantry of the coast of
Cardigan, in their red whittles, when the French landed
during the war of the revolution, the force opposed to the
enemy was apparently doubled or tripled.</p>

<p>Alfonso of Arragon, seeing this, exclaimed, &ldquo;Have the
Genoese wings, that they can come to Bonifacio when we
are keeping a strict blockade by land and by sea?&rdquo; And
again he gave orders for the assault, and his engines shot
a storm of missiles against the place. Three days afterwards,
the relieving fleet anchored off the harbour, and
some brave Bonifacians, swimming off to the ships, horrified
the Genoese by their haggard and famine-worn
features. After a terrible fight, which lasted for seven
hours&mdash;ship jammed against ship in the narrow channel,
and the Bonifacians hurling firebrands, harpoons, and all
kinds of missiles on such of the enemy's ships as they
could reach from the walls and towers&mdash;the Genoese burst
the chain across the harbour, and unbounded was the joy
of the famished townsmen when seven ships, loaded with
corn, were safely moored along the Marino. Alfonso of
Arragon raised the siege, and, abandoning his enterprise in
deep mortification, sailed for Italy.</p>

<p>The citizens of Bonifacio displayed equal heroism in
defence of their town in 1554. It was then the turn of
Henry IV. of France to invade Corsica. Invited by Sampiero
and the other patriot chiefs, the French troops,
acting in concert with the island militia, drove the Genoese
from all their positions except some fortified places on the
coast; while the Turks, the natural enemies of the republic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
co-operating with the French, appeared off the island with
a powerful fleet, under the command of their admiral,
Dragut, and laid siege to Bonifacio.</p>

<p>The defence offered by the townsmen was all the more
obstinate from their being inspired with the sentiment that
it was a religious duty to fight against the Infidel. Again
the women rushed to the ramparts, and fell gloriously in
the breach. The Turks had been repulsed with great
slaughter in repeated assaults, and Dragut had drawn off
his forces to some distance, disconcerted, and almost resolved
to raise the siege, when an unexpected occurrence
brought it to an end. An inhabitant of Bonifacio was
entrusted by the senate of Genoa to carry over a sum of
money, and announce the approach of succour to the besieged
town. Landing at Girolata, he was making his way
through the island, when, betrayed by one of his guides,
he was arrested, and brought to De Thermes, the French
general. Means were found of inducing the Genoese
emissary to betray his employers. He was instructed to
proceed to Bonifacio with Da Mare, a Corsican noble, and
engage the authorities to surrender, informing them that
the Genoese could afford them no relief.</p>

<p>The stratagem succeeded. The letters of credence with
which the traitor had been furnished at Genoa satisfied the
commandant of the truth of his mission, and he consented
to deliver up the place to Da Mare, on condition that the
town should be saved from pillage, and the soldiers conducted
to Bastia, and embarked for Genoa. But when the
Turks saw those brave men, who had foiled all their
assaults by an obstinate defence, file out of the place, they
fell on them, and massacred them without mercy. Moreover,
Dragut demanded that Bonifacio should be put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
his hands, or that he should receive an indemnity of 25,000
crowns. It was impossible to deliver up a town to be
sacked by the Turks, the inhabitants of which it was policy
to conciliate, nor could De Thermes provide the sum required.
He promised, however, speedy payment, and sent
his nephew to the Turks as an hostage. Dragut then
sailed for the Levant, in dudgeon with his allies, and disgusted
with an enterprise which had terminated so little to
his honour. Bonifacio, with the rest of Corsica, was soon
afterwards restored by the treaty of Ch&acirc;teau-Cambresis to
the Genoese, who repaired and considerably added to the
fortifications.</p>

<p>One easily conceives that the rock fortress must have
been impregnable in ancient times, if bravely defended.
Even now it is a place of considerable strength, garrisoned
by the French, who have erected barracks and improved
the works. But the place still singularly preserves the
character of a fortified town of the Middle Ages. Nothing
seems changed except that French sentries pace the battlements
instead of Genoese. There are the old towers, walls,
churches, and houses;&mdash;the houses, tall and gloomy, many
of them having the arms of Genoese families carved in
stone over the portals. A network of narrow and irregular
streets spreads over the whole <i>plateau</i> within the
walls, which rise from the very edge of the cliffs. There is
not a yard of vacant space, except an esplanade and <i>place
d'armes</i>, where the promontory narrows at its southern
extremity. The only entrance is under the vaulted archway
of the barbican, still as jealously guarded as if Saracen,
Turk, or Spaniard threatened an attack. This tower commands
the approach from the Marino by the broad ramp,
a long inclined plane, at a sharp angle, the ascent of which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
<i>en &eacute;chelon</i>, by the troops of diminutive mules and asses
employed for conveying all articles necessary for subsistence
and use in the town, it was painful to witness. The
streets are as void of every kind of vehicle as those of
Venice, and almost as unsavoury as its canals. There is
scarcely room for two loaded mules to pass each other.
Every morning, nearly the whole population pours forth,
with their beasts of burthen, to their labour in the country,
there being no villages in the canton; returning to their
homes in the evening. They are an industrious race,
snatching their subsistence from a barren soil.</p>

<p>Few strangers visit Bonifacio, and those who do must be
content with very indifferent accommodations. We were
lodged <i>au premier</i> of a gaunt <i>locanda</i>, our last resource,
after exploring the place for better quarters. Its best recommendation
was the zeal and kindness of the host; and
even the resources of his culinary skill, which, I believe,
could have produced a <i>ragout</i> from a piece of leather, failed
for want of materials on which to exercise it. The supplies
of flesh, fowl, and&mdash;strange to say&mdash;fish, were scanty
and bad. The French officers in garrison messed, <i>en pension</i>,
at our hotel, but their fare, limited by a close economy,
was not only meagre, but, with all the accompaniments of
the table, absolutely disgusting.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, we were detained several days
beyond our allotted time in this ill-provisioned fortress by
an unexpected mischance. Armed with Foreign Office
passports, current at least through the friendly states of
France and Sardinia without the slightest hindrance, we
had taken the additional precaution of proposing to have
them <i>vis&eacute;</i> by the French and Sardinian Legations in London,
that there might be no sort of obstacle to our crossing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
one of the two islands in our route to the other. The <i>vis&eacute;</i>
was refused as perfectly unnecessary; and even at Ajaccio,
where we passed some hours at the <i>Pr&eacute;feture</i>, our passports
were returned to us on mere inspection. Greatly,
however, to our mortification, we discovered, at Bonifacio,
that international conventions between friendly governments
had no force in this out-of-the-way corner of the
civilised world. We could not be allowed to embark for
Sardinia without authority from the Administration at
Ajaccio, which it would take at least forty-eight hours to
procure. All arguments were vain; the Foreign Office
passport could not be recognised; the orders were precise
for a strict <i>surveillance</i> of all persons endeavouring to
cross the Straits. As private individuals and English gentlemen,
we were on particularly pleasant terms with the
<i>maire</i> and his son; but, officially, such was their language,
they had nothing to show that we were not brigands meditating
escape. Officials generally, and foreign officials
especially, are not to be moved by any force of circumstances
from their regular track.</p>

<p>Unwilling to submit, and anxious to get forward, we lost
twenty-four hours of precious time in vainly negotiating
with the master of a small vessel to smuggle us over.
He would be well paid, and we proposed going to some
unfrequented part of the coast, from whence he could take
us off. But, tempting as the offers were, after much deliberation,
they were rejected. Such things were common
a short time before, and hundreds of the banditti had been
ferried over to the coast of Sardinia; but now there was
a sharp look-out, and discovery would be ruin. Insignificant
as is the commerce of Bonifacio, it is well watched by
a staff of <i>douaniers</i>, consisting of a captain, four <i>sous-officiers</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and thirteen or fourteen <i>pr&eacute;pos&eacute;s</i>, <i>matelots</i>, &amp;c.,
besides <i>officiers de sant&eacute;</i> and swarms of <i>gendarmes</i>. They
were everywhere: at our landing; while sketching; always
in pairs; and seeming to dodge our steps. Two presented
themselves while we were at supper the evening after
our arrival. The passports had been exhibited;&mdash;what
could they want with us? what offence had we committed?
Their business was with the innkeeper; he had omitted to
fix a lantern at his door! He hated the French like a
true Corsican. He would not pay even decent respect to
the officers, his guests, and boasted of starving them to
the last fraction his contract for the mess allowed; while
nothing was good enough for the Englishmen.</p>

<p>Pi&eacute;tro was, indeed, a true Corsican; had killed his man,
given a <i>coup</i>, as he called it, to his enemy, was condemned
to death, but bought off. <i>Encore</i>; a man he had offended
came to his hotel, and called for food. They sat down to
table in company, Pi&eacute;tro observing that his enemy frequently
kept his hand on a side-pocket. After supper, the
man asked for a chamber to sleep. Pi&eacute;tro replied that
they were all occupied, but he might sleep with him. The
other was staggered at his coolness, and, hesitating to
comply, Pi&eacute;tro seized him, and finding a pistol secreted on
his person, doubled him up, and kicked him down stairs.</p>

<p>Our host was not singular in his disaffection to the
French. The Bonifacians feel their thraldom more perhaps
than any other people in Corsica, overshadowed as their
small population is by a strong garrison and a host of
<i>douaniers</i> and <i>gendarmes</i>. Republican ideas prevail; and
they have not forgotten the days when their important town
was more an ally, than a dependance, of Genoa. Now,
from their small population, a single deputy represents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
them in the departmental council, while Ajaccio sends
twenty-nine and Bastia twenty-five members. The Bonifacians
despise their masters. &ldquo;The French are inconstant,&rdquo;
said an inhabitant, high in office, with whom I
was talking politics; &ldquo;they have <i>tant de petitesses</i>; they
have no national character: we have, and you;&mdash;our very
quarrels, which are deep and lasting, show it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everything is primitive in Bonifacio, except the emblems
of French domination. On the evening of our arrival,
having threaded my way alone with some difficulty through
a labyrinth of dark streets and lanes to the Post Office, I
found it closed; and there being no apparent means of
announcing my errand, was departing in despair, when
a neighbour good-humouredly cried out, &ldquo;<i>Tirate la corda,
signore!</i>&rdquo; After some search, for it was getting dark, I
discovered a string, running up the wall of the house to
the third story. Pulling it lustily, at last a window
opened, and an old woman put her head out, inquiring, in
a shrill voice, &ldquo;<i>Que volete?</i>&rdquo; Having made known my
wants, after some delay, steps were heard slowly descending
the stairs. Admitted at length into the <i>bureau</i>, the
old crone, spectacle on nose, proceeded very deliberately to
spell over, by a feeble lamplight, the addresses of a bundle
of letters taken from a shelf. The process was excruciating,
anxious as we were for news from home. She could make
nothing of my friend's truly Saxon name;&mdash;what foreign
official can ever decipher English names? Mine was more
pronounceable, and as I kept repeating both, she caught
that, and, incapable as I should have thought her of
making a pun, she exclaimed at last, in despair, &ldquo;<i>Forestier,
ecco! sono tutti foresti&egrave;re</i>,&rdquo; tossing me the whole bundle
to choose for myself. Happily, I was not disappointed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall not easily forget Bonifacio. Our detention
within the narrow bounds of the fortress-town afforded us
leisure to realise the scenes which the crowded <i>enceinte</i>
must have offered during its memorable sieges. The combined
effects, too, of loathsome smells&mdash;the filth of the
purlieus being indescribable&mdash;of bad diet, confinement,
and the irritation natural to Englishmen under detention,
brought on suddenly severe attacks of diarrh&#339;a, though
we were both before in robust health. Our sufferings
shadowed out, however faintly, the miseries endured by a
crowded population during the sieges, and again when half
the inhabitants of Bonifacio became victims to the plague
in 1582&mdash;a scourge which then devastated Corsica and
parts of Italy.</p>

<p>Gasping for pure air, we were forbidden by the everwatchful
<i>gendarmes</i> to walk on the town ramparts. From
early dawn till late evening, the eternal clang of hand cornmills
forbade repose in our <i>locanda</i>. The neighbouring
country has few attractions, even if we had been in a state
to profit by them. All interest is concentrated in the place
itself. Our steps were therefore especially attracted to the
open area forming
the southern
extremity of the
Cape, as already
mentioned.
There at least
we could breathe
the fresh air, look
down on the blue Mediterranean washing the base of the
chalk cliffs, far beneath, and trace the outline of the coast
of Sardinia across the Straits. The Gallura mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
rose boldly on the horizon, and the low island of Madal&eacute;na,
our proposed landing-place, was distinctly visible.
It needed not that we should indulge imagination in picturing
to ourselves Castel Sardo, and other places along
the coast, which we hoped soon to visit. The esplanade
was generally solitary, and suited our musings. One
evening, the silence was broken by a melancholy chant
from the chapel of a ruined monastery within the guarded
<i>enceinte</i>. It was a service for the dead, at which a prostrate
crowd assisted in deep devotion. The sentries on the
walls rested on their arms, and we stood at the open door,
facing the western sky and the rolling waves, listening to
strains of wailing which would have suited the times of
the siege and the plague.</p>

</div>

<p>Nearer the town stands the old church of the Templars,
dedicated to St. Dominic, of fine Gothic architecture, full
of interest for its armorial and other memorials of the
knightly defenders of the faith, and of noble Genoese
families. Over the edge of the cliff towers the massive
<i>Torrione</i>, the original fortress of the Marquis Bonifacio,
consecrated in memory as long the bulwark of the island
against the incursions of Saracen corsairs. Here, is the
spot where the hastily-built galley, with its adventurous
crew, was lowered down the face of the cliff, to convey to
Genoa the intelligence of the extremity to which the citizens
of Bonifacio were reduced when besieged by Alfonso
of Arragon. There, is a ladder of rude steps, cut in the
chalk cliffs to the edge of the water, two hundred feet
beneath, the descent of which it made one dizzy to contemplate.
Perhaps, under cover of night, the now ruinous
steps have been boldly trodden in a sally for surprising the
enemy, or stealthily mounted by emissaries from without,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
conveying intelligence to the beleaguered party. Perhaps,
in the Genoese times, some Romeo and Juliet, of rival families,
found the means of elopement by this sequestered
staircase. One could imagine shrouded figures gliding
from the convent church close by&mdash;the perilous descent,
the light skiff tossing beneath, with its white sails a-peak,
waiting to bear off the lovers to freedom and bliss. For
what legends and tales of romance, real or imaginary, have
we materials here!</p>

<p>It is by sea only that one can escape from Bonifacio, except
by miles of dreary road. To the sea we looked for ours.
<i>En attendant</i>, we tried our wings to the utmost length of
the chain which bound us to the rock. Procuring a boat,
we pulled out of the harbour, and round the jutting points
crowned by the fortress, half inclined to pitch the <i>padrone</i>
overboard, and make a straight course for the opposite
coast of Sardinia. Not driven to that extremity, we
wiled away the time pleasantly enough in a visit to the
caverns worn by the sea in the chalk cliffs, which front
its surges. Some of these are exceedingly picturesque.
Their entrances
festooned
with hanging
boughs, they
penetrate far
into the interior
of the
rocks, and the
water percolating
through
their vaulted
roofs, has formed stalactites of fantastic shapes. The boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
glides through the arched entrance, and we find ourselves
in the cool and grateful shade of these marine grottoes.
Fishes are flitting in the clear water; limpid streams
oozing through the rocks form fresh-water basins, with
pebbly bottoms; and the channels from the blue sea, flowing
over the chalk, become cerulean. These are, indeed,
the halls of Amphitrite, fitting baths of Thetis and her
nymphs. Poetic imagination has never pictured anything
more enchanting.</p>

</div>

<p>One afternoon, we walked a mile out of the town, up a
narrow valley in the limestone cliffs, to the ruined convent
of St. Julian. The bottom of the valley is laid out in
gardens, with cross walls, and channels for irrigation.
The gardens appeared neglected, but there were some
vines and fig-trees, pomegranates, and crops of a large-growing
kale. The ruins lie at the head of the glen,
facing Bonifacio and the sea; the walls of the convent
and church still standing, approached by a broad paved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
way on a flight of marble steps. Seated on these, we
enjoyed at leisure a charming view.</p>

<p>Vineyards and plots of cultivated land overspread the
slopes on either side of the valley. There were scattered
olive-trees, and bamboos waving in the wind. The old
convent walls, mantled with ivy, contrasted with a chapel
at the foot of the steps, having a handsome dome, covered
with bright glazed tiles of green, red, and black, and surmounted
by a cross&mdash;the only portion of the conventual
buildings still perfect. In the distance was the little landlocked
haven, with a brig and some small lateen-sailed
vessels moored alongside the Marino. Above it rose
the fortress-town, with its towers and battlements. The
sound of the church bells tolling for vespers rose, softened
by distance, up the valley. Ravens were croaking over the
ruins of the convent, and lizards frisking on the banks
and the marble steps on which we reposed. It was a fitting
spot for a Sunday afternoon's meditation&mdash;our last in
Corsica!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Released, at length, from our irksome detention by the
return of the courier with the passports <i>vis&eacute;s</i> from Ajaccio,
and a boat we had hired, meanwhile, lying ready at the
Marino to carry us over to Sardinia, not a moment was
lost in getting under sail to cross the straits.</p>

<p>The Bocche di Bonifacio were called by the Romans
<i>Fossa Fretum</i>, and by the Greeks <i>Tappros</i>, a trench, from
their dividing the islands of Corsica and Sardinia like a
ditch or dyke. These straits are considered dangerous by
navigators, from the violence of the squalls gushing suddenly
from the mountains and causing strong currents,
especially during the prevalence of winds from the north-west
during nine months of the year. Lord Nelson
describes them during one of these squalls as &ldquo;looking
tremendous, from the number of rocks and the heavy seas
breaking over them.&rdquo; In another letter he says, &ldquo;We
worked the &#8216;Victory&#8217; every foot of the way from Asinara
to this anchorage, [off La Madelena,] blowing hard from
Longo Sardo, under double-reefed topsails.&rdquo; The difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of the Bonifacio passage can hardly be understood
by a landsman who has not visited the straits, but they
are stated to have been so great, &ldquo;and the ships to have
passed in so extraordinary a manner, that their captains
could only consider it as a providential interposition in
favour of the great officer who commanded them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It has been my fortune to pass these straits on three
several occasions when they were perfectly calm. During
the passage from Corsica in an open boat, which I am now
relating, there was so little wind that, with all the spread
of high-peaked sails a Mediterranean boat can carry, we
made but little
way, and the
surface was so
unruffled that
my friend was
able to sketch
at ease the outline
of the Corsican
mountains,
from which we were slowly receding. It was, however,
pleasurable to linger midway between the two islands,
retracing our route in the one by the lines of its mountain
ranges, and anticipating fresh delight in penetrating those
of the Gallura now in prospect. The appearance of a
French revenue cutter to windward tended to reconcile us
to the failure of our plan of getting smuggled across the
straits, which might have led to more serious consequences
than the detention we suffered.</p>

<p>The coast line on both sides of the channel, as on all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the shores of the two islands, is remarkably bold; and the
scene was diversified by the groups of rocky islets scattered
across the straits, and described in a former chapter
as the broken links of a chain which once united Corsica
with the mountain system of the north-east-portion of the
island of Sardinia. They are composed entirely of a fine-grained
red granite. In some of the islets lying nearest
the Corsican coast quarries were worked to supply blocks
and columns for the temples and palaces of imperial
Rome. Quarries of the same material were also worked
by the Romans, as we shall find presently, on the coast of
Sardinia, opposite these islands.</p>

<p>With two exceptions, these &ldquo;Intermediate Islands&rdquo; are
uninhabited. They were considered of so little importance
that, till the middle of the last century, it was considered
a question which of them belonged to Sardinia
and which to Corsica. It was then easily settled by
drawing a visual line equidistant from Point Lo Sprono on
the latter, and Capo Falcone on the former; it being
agreed that all north of this line should belong to Corsica,
and all south of it to Sardinia.</p>

<p>The distance between the two capes is about ten nautical
miles. To the westward of Capo Falcone lies the small
harbour of Longo Sardo, or Longone, the nearest landing-place
from Bonifacio, from which it has long carried on a
contraband trade; its proximity to Corsica also making it
the asylum of the outlaws exiled from that island. A
new town, called Villa Teresa, built on a more healthy
spot on the neighbouring heights, has received a considerable
access of population from the same source.</p>

<p>The Capes Falcone, with La Marmorata close by, and
La Testa forming the north-west point of Sardinia, are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
of the same formation as the rocky islands in the straits
already mentioned, and, like them, this district furnished
the Romans with many of the granite columns which still
form magnificent ornaments of the Eternal City. Those
of the Pantheon are said to have been excavated near
Longone; and several similar ones, as well as rude blocks,
may still be seen in the quarries on the promontory of
Santa Reparata, near which the remains of some Roman
villas have also been discovered. In later days we find
the value of the Gallura granite appreciated by the Pisans.
Their Duomo, built by Buschetto in 1063, soon after their
possession of Sardinia, shows the beauty of the Marmorata
rocks; and the Battisterio, built in 1152 by Dioti Salvi,
has also much of Gallura material in its construction.</p>

<p>La Madelena is the largest island in the Sardinian
group, and while Porto Longone is a poor place, the town
and harbour of La Madelena are much frequented in the
communications and trade between Corsica and Sardinia.
Our course therefore was shaped for the latter, though
twice the distance from shore to shore. The island of La
Madelena, the <i>Insula Ilva</i>, or <i>Phintonis</i>, of the Romans, is
about eleven miles in circumference. Till about a century
ago it was only inhabited or frequented by shepherds, natives
of Corsica, who led a nomad life, and by their constant
intercourse with Corsica and Sardinia, and by intermarriages
with natives of both, formed a mixed but distinct race, as
the Ilvese are still considered. The town of La Madelena
was only founded in 1767, some Corsican refugees being
among its first settlers; but from its fine harbour, the
healthiness of its site, and its convenience for commerce
with Italy, it rapidly became a place of considerable population
and trade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>There are numerous channels and many sheltered bays
frequented by ships between the group of islands of which
La Madelena is the principal. Our own course from the
north-west led us through a strait between the main land
of Sardinia and the islands of Sparagi, Madelena, and Caprera,
which opened to view all the points of interest in
its most celebrated harbour. Right ahead, it was almost
closed by the little rocky islet of Santo Stefano, now
defended by a fort, and remarkable for having been the
scene of a severe repulse received by Napoleon at the
outset of his long successful career. A point to the south,
on the main land of Sardinia, marking the entrance of the
Gulf of Arsachena, is called the Capo dell'Orso, from a
mass of granite so exactly resembling the figure of a bear
recumbent on its hind legs, that it attracted the notice of
Ptolemy 1400 years ago. The island of Caprera, probably
deriving its name from the wild goats till lately its
sole inhabitants, presents a ridge of rugged mountains,
rising in the centre to a ridge called Tagiolona, upwards of
750 feet high, with some little sheltered bays, and a few
cultivated spots on its western side.</p>

<p>Sheltered by Caprera, La Madelena, and Santo Stefano,
we find the fine anchorage of Mezzo Schifo; the town of
La Madelena, for which we are steering, lying about half
a mile south-west of the anchorage. This harbour, named
by Lord Nelson &ldquo;Agincourt Sound,&rdquo; was his head-quarters
while maintaining the blockade of Toulon, from 1803 to
1805. He formed the highest opinion of its position for a
naval station, as affording safe and sheltered anchorage,
and ingress and egress with any winds. His public and
private correspondence at that period shows the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
he attached to its possession, and his anxiety that it
should be secured permanently to the crown of England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we could possess the island of Sardinia,&rdquo; he says,
in a letter to Lord Hobart, &ldquo;we should want neither
Malta nor any other island in the Mediterranean. This,
which is the finest of them, possesses harbours fit for
arsenals, and of a capacity to hold our navy,&mdash;within
twenty-four hours' sail of Toulon,&mdash;bays to ride our fleets
in, and to watch both Italy and Toulon.&rdquo; In another
letter, he says:&mdash;&ldquo;What a noble harbour is formed by
these islands! The world cannot produce a finer. From
its position, it is worth fifty Maltas.&rdquo; This opinion we
find repeated in a variety of forms, and with Nelson's
characteristic energy of expression.</p>

<p>When at anchor in Agincourt Sound, he kept two or
three frigates constantly cruising between Toulon and the
Straits of Bonifacio, to signal any attempt of the enemy
to leave their port; occasionally cruising with his whole
fleet, and then retreating to head-quarters. His sudden
appearance and disappearance off Toulon, in one of these
exercises, with the hope of alluring the French to put to
sea, led their admiral, M. Latouche-Tr&eacute;ville, to make the
ludicrous boast, that he had chased the whole British
fleet, which fled before him. This bravado so irritated
Nelson, that it drew from him the well-known threat,
contained in a letter to his brother: &ldquo;You will have seen
by Latouche's letter how he chased me, and how I ran. I
keep it; and, if I take him, by God, he shall eat it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our boatman pointed out to us the channel through
which Lord Nelson led his fleet when at length, after
more than two years' watching, the object of all his hopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and vows was accomplished by the French fleet putting to
sea. This, the eastern channel, of which the low isle of
Biscie forms the outer point, is the most dangerous of all,
from the sunken rocks which lie in the fairway, and its
little breadth of sea room. Yet Nelson beat through it in
a gale of wind, in the dusk of the evening, escaping these
dangers almost miraculously. Our sailor pointed out all
this with lively interest, for Nelson's name and heroic
deeds are still household words among the seafaring
people of La Madelena.</p>

<p>It was on the 19th of January, 1805, that the look-out
frigate in the offing signalled to the admiral that the
French fleet had put to sea. At that season there was
much gaiety, in dances, private theatricals, and other
amusements, on board the different ships in the harbour,
and preparations for an evening's entertainment were
going on at the moment the stirring signal was discovered.
It was no sooner acknowledged on board the &ldquo;Victory&rdquo;
than the responding one appeared, &ldquo;Weigh immediately!&rdquo;
The scene of excitement and confusion ensuing the sudden
departure and interruption of festivities may be easily conceived.
It was a dark wintry evening; but the suddenness
of the order to get under way was equalled by the skill
and courage with which it was executed. The passage is
so narrow that only one ship could pass at a time, and
each was guided only by the stern lights of the preceding
vessel. At seven o'clock, the whole of the fleet was entirely
clear of the passage, and, bidding a long farewell to
La Madelena, they stood to the southward in pursuit of
the French fleet. The daring and determined spirit exhibited
by Nelson on this particular occasion was the subject
of especial eulogy in the House of Lords by his late Majesty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
then Duke of Clarence; being cited as the greatest
instance of his unflinching courage and constant activity.</p>

<p>Thus, as we have already found Corsica, we now see
Sardinia, witnessing some of the boldest achievements of
our great naval hero.</p>

<p>Further interest attaches to La Madelena from its
having repulsed the attack of Napoleon, and driven him
to a precipitate retreat from his first field of arms. The
young soldier, after being for some months in garrison at
Bonifacio, was attached, by order of Paschal Paoli, to the
expedition which sailed from thence in February, 1793, to
reduce La Madelena. He acted as second in command of
the artillery, the whole force being under the command of
General Colonna-Cesari. A body of troops having effected
a lodgment on the island of Santo Stefano by night, and a
battery having been thrown up and armed, a heavy fire was
opened by Bonaparte on the town and its defences. They
were held by a garrison of 500 men, and the fire was
returned by the islanders with equal fury. The opposite
shore of Gallura was lined by its brave mountaineers,
who, on the French frigate being dismasted and bearing
up for the Gulf of Arsachena, embarked from Parao, and
attacked Santo Stefano. Their assault was so vigorous that
Bonaparte found himself compelled to make a precipitate
retreat from the island with a few of his followers, leaving
200 prisoners, with all the <i>mat&eacute;riel</i>, baggage, and artillery.
In passing between the other islands, the fugitives were
also attacked by some Gallurese, who, concealing themselves
near Capo della Caprera, by the precision of their
firing committed great havoc on the flying enemy.</p>

<p>Mr. Tyndale states that many of the Corsicans and
Ilvese who witnessed this action, being still living when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
he visited La Madelena, and relating various circumstances
relative to it, he heard the following story from an old
veteran, who was an eyewitness of the fact:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bonaparte was superintending the firing from the
battery, and watching the effect of it with his telescope,
when observing the people at Madelena going to mass, he
exclaimed, &#8216;<i>Voglio tirare alla chiesa, per far fuggire le
donne!</i>&#8217; (&#8216;I should like to fire at the church, just to
frighten the women!&#8217;) While in garrison at Bonifacio,
as lieutenant [? captain] of artillery, he had mortar and
gun practice every morning, and had on all occasions
shown the greatest precision in firing. In this instance
he was no less successful, for the shell entered the church
window, and fell at the foot of the image of N.S. di Madelena.
It failed to burst in this presence, and this miraculous
instance of religious respect had its due weight
with the pious islanders, by whom it was taken up, and
for a long time preserved among the sacred curiosities of
the town. A natural cause was, however, soon discovered
for the harmlessness of the projectile. Napoleon continued
his firing; but finding that the shells took no effect,
though they fell on the very spot he intended, he examined
some of them, and found that they were filled with sand.
&#8216;<i>Amici</i>,&#8217; he exclaimed, burning with indignation; &#8216;<i>eccole
il tradimento</i>;&#8217; and the troops, who had been suffering
much by the fire from Madelena, imagining that the
treason was on the part of General Cesari, would have
put him <i>alla lanterna</i>, had he not made his escape on
board the frigate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It has, indeed, been said that Paoli, reluctantly obeying
the orders of the French Convention to undertake the
expedition against Sardinia, entrusted the command to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Colonna-Cesari, his intimate friend, with instructions to
secure its failure, considering Sardinia as the natural ally
of their own island. However this may be, the affair terminated
by the retreat of the general with the rest of his
force, having thrown from Santo Stefano 500 shells and
5000 round shot into Madelena, without much effect.</p>

<p>We found in the harbour a Sardinian steam-ship of war<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>,
and ten or twelve vessels of very small tonnage, engaged
in the trade with Corsica, Leghorn, and Marseilles. About
twenty of this class belong to the port; besides which it is
frequented annually by from 200 to 300 other small vessels,
principally Genoese, their united tonnage amounting
to about 5000 tons. Besides this legitimate commerce,
the Ilvese carry on a prosperous contraband trade, taking
advantage of the numerous little creeks and bays along
the rocky coasts of the island. They are naturally a seafaring
people, while the Sardes manifest a decided repugnance
to engage in seafaring pursuits. The quays round
the port of Madelena are spacious, and the town, straggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
up the side of a hill, has a neat appearance, is said
to be healthy, and is cleaner than any Sardinian town we
saw.</p>

<p>There are tolerable accommodations at Santa's Hotel.
The reception of foreign guests is however, I imagine, a
rare occurrence, and the means of supplying the table
from the resources of the island appeared scanty; so that
we should have fared ill but for the kindness of an English
officer long settled at Madelena, who sent some substantial
contributions to our comforts, in addition to his
own hospitality. The name of Captain Roberts, <span class="smcap">R.N.</span>, is so
well known to all visitors, as well as among the Sardes,
that it is public property, and I may be allowed to bear
testimony to the high esteem in which the hearty and
genial old sailor is generally held. His loss would occasion
a blank at Madelena not easily filled up; and I was
happy to hear on my last visit to Sardinia that his health
had improved.</p>

<p>More English, I believe, are settled in the neighbourhood
of La Madelena than in the whole island of Sardinia;
if, indeed, there are any to be found, we did not hear of
them. The English visitors consist principally of officers
on shooting excursions from Malta. We had a very pleasant
walk along the shore to the villa of an Australian
colonist who, after wandering about the world, had, seemingly
to his content, settled down on a small farm on the
slopes of a valley a mile or two from the town. A man
fond of cultivation might be very happy here, with such a
climate, and the means of commanding a profusion of
vegetables, fruits, and flowers. Irrigation was effected
from a well provided with the simple machinery for lifting
the water common in such countries, and by its aid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
gardens just seeded and planted for the spring, or rather
winter, crops, so early is vegetation, looked greener and
fresher than anything we had seen for a long time. The
cauliflowers and peas were already making forward progress;
the latter, indeed, grow wild in this neighbourhood.
But while these carried us in imagination to the latter
days of an English spring, the hedges of prickly pear bore
witness to the arid nature of the soil and the heat of the
climate; of that, indeed, we were very sensible in our
walks, though the month of November had now commenced.</p>

<p>A cottage occupied, it was said, by an English botanist
was pointed out to us; and an English family has been
settled for some time in the solitude of the island of
Caprera, of whose improvements great things were said.
Every one spoke especially of Mrs. C.'s beautiful flower
garden, and an anecdote was told respecting it, characteristic,
I think, rather of Sarde than of English feeling. On
some occasion when the king visited La Madelena, Mrs. C.
having been requested to contribute flowers to the decorations
of the festa in preparation to do honour to the
royal visit, she is said to have replied: &ldquo;I cultivate my
flowers for my own pleasure&mdash;<i>pour m'amuser</i>&mdash;not to
ingratiate myself with a court. If his majesty desires to
see them, he must come to Caprera.&rdquo; I cannot vouch for
the truth of the story, though it was in every one's mouth.
What amused me was, that the islanders considered this
as evincing a truly English spirit of independence, which
they heartily approved.</p>

<p>The principal church of La Madelena, dedicated to St.
Mary Magdalene, is a neat structure of granite and marble.
Its decorations are less gaudy than those one usually sees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the most valued ornaments being a pair of massive altar
candlesticks and a crucifix, all of silver, the gift of Lord
Nelson, in acknowledgment of the kindness and hospitality
he received from the islanders while his fleet lay in the
harbour. On the base of the candlesticks are enchased
the arms of Nelson and Bront&euml;, with this inscription:</p>

<p class="center">
VICE COMES<br />
NELSON NILI<br />
DUX BRONTIS ECC<sup>E.</sup><br />
ST<sup>E.</sup> MAGDAL<sup>E.</sup> INS<sup>E.</sup><br />
ST<sup>E.</sup> MAGDAL<sup>E.</sup><br />
D.D.D.
</p>

<p>It is said that when the town publicly thanked Lord
Nelson for the donation, he replied: &ldquo;These little ornaments
are nothing; wait till I catch the French outside
their port. If they will but come out, I am sure to capture
them; and I promise to give you the value of one of their
frigates to build a church with. I have only to ask you
to pray to La Santissima Madonna that the French fleet
may come out of Toulon. Do you pray to her for that,
and as for capturing them, I will undertake to do all the
rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We landed at La Madelena on the anniversary of the
day when Nelson first anchored his fleet off the town just
fifty years before. As we trace his career among the
Mediterranean islands, recollections of those eventful
times crowd on our memories. In the half century that
has intervened, how has the aspect of affairs changed!</p>

<p>It was the eve of the feast of All Saints (1st Nov.),
devoutly observed, with that of All Souls on the day following,
in all Catholic countries. From daylight till ten
at night the bells of St. Magdalene incessantly clanged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and the church was thronged with successive crowds,
absorbed in pious and affectionate devotion to the memories
of their departed friends, according to the rites of the
Roman Church. How thrilling are the deep tones of the
<i>De Profundis</i> from the compositions of a good musical
school! And what observance can be more touching than
this periodical commemoration of the dead? There is
none that more harmonises with the best feelings of our
nature; and yet of all the dogmas rejected by ecclesiastical
reforms, I know of none which has less pretensions
to Scriptural authority or has been more mischievous,
corrupting alike the priesthood and the laity, than that
which makes the masses and prayers incident to the commemoration
of the dead propitiatory for sins committed in
the flesh.</p>

<p>The solemn festival brought out all the women of La
Madelena, never perhaps seen to more advantage than in
a costume of black silk, suited to the solemnity, with the
Genoese mantle of white transparent muslin attached to
the back of the head, and falling gracefully over the
shoulders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The halt at La Madelena was only a step in our route to
the main island. We had still to cross a broad channel,
and landing at Parao, on the Sardinian shore, horses were
to be waiting for us. This arrangement, kindly made by
Captain Roberts, required a day's delay. We were to
proceed to Tempio, in the heart of the Gallura Mountains,
under guidance of the courier in charge of the post

found the horses tethered among the bushes. House there
was none, which must be inconvenient when the weather
is too tempestuous for crossing the strait from Parao. We
took shelter from the heat under a rook, making studies of
a group of picturesque shepherds, and amusing ourselves
with some luscious grapes,&mdash;baskets of which were waiting
for the return of the passage-boat to La Madelena,&mdash;while
a pack-horse was loaded with our baggage.</p>

<p>The outfit for this expedition was more than usually
cumbersome, as it comprised blankets and other appendages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
for camping out, if occasion required. The cavallante,
however, made nothing of stowing it away, cleverly
thrusting bag and baggage into the capacious leather
pouches which hung balanced on each side of the stout
beast, with a portmanteau across the pack-saddle. When
all was done, the cavallante mounted to the top of the
load, where he perched himself like an Arab on a dromedary.</p>

<p>The cavallo Sardo <i>par excellence</i>, such as the higher
classes ride, is a strong spirited barb, highly valued. These
horses are carefully broken to a peculiar step, called the
&ldquo;portante,&rdquo; something between an amble and a trot, for
which we have neither a corresponding word or pace. I
cannot say that I admired the pace. It only makes
four or five miles an hour, and, to my apprehension,
might be described as a shuffle, not being so easy as a
canter, nor having the invigorating swing of a trot. The
natives, however, consider the movement delightful; and
a writer on Sardinia says: &ldquo;<i>Il viaggiare in Sardegna &egrave;
perci&ograve; la pi&ugrave; dolce cosa del mondo; l'antipongo all'andare
in barca col vento in poppa</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The travelling in Sardinia
is, on this account, one of the pleasantest things in the
world; I prefer it to sailing in a vessel with the wind
astern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ordinary Sarde horse is a hardy, sure-footed animal,
undersized, but capable of carrying heavy burthens. Great
numbers of them are kept, as the poorest native disdains
walking. They are ill fed, and have rough treatment. As
pack-horses they convey all the commodities of home produce,
or imported and interchanged, throughout the interior
of the island, there being scarcely any roads, and consequently
no wheel-carriages employed, except on the Strada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Reale, through the level plains of the Campidano, between
Cagliari and Porto Torres.</p>

<p>The <i>viandanti</i> who conduct this traffic are a numerous
and hardy class of people, much enduring in the long and
toilsome journeys through such a country as their vocation
requires them to traverse. We found them civil, patient,
and attentive, but hard at a bargain,&mdash;so that this mode of
travelling is more expensive than might be expected,&mdash;and
occasionally rather independent. A curious instance of
this occurred at Tempio. We had made a bargain, on his
own terms, with one of these people, for horses to proceed
on our route, and they were brought to the door ready for
loading up and mounting, when the cavallante refused to
allow our using our English saddles. Not wishing to lose
time, we took considerable pains to point out that the
saddles being well padded would not wring his horses'
backs, conceiving that to be what he apprehended. But
it was to no purpose; there seemed to be no other reason
for the scruple than that a Sarde horse must be caparisoned
<i>&agrave; la Sarde</i>, with high-peaked saddle and velvet housings.
The cavallante, persisting, led his horses back to the stable,
losing a profitable engagement rather than being willing
to submit to their being equipped in a foreign fashion.
After a short delay we procured others from a cavallante
who made no such difficulties, and proved a very serviceable
and attentive conductor.</p>

<p class="caption">VALLEY OF THE LISCIA.</p>
</div>

<p>After leaving Parao, and calling at a solitary <i>stazza</i> or
farm, the track we pursued led through a wide plain
watered by the Liscia. The river made many windings
among meadows clothed with luxuriant herbage, and fed
by numerous herds of cattle, and sheep, and goats; forming
a pastoral scene of singular beauty, of which my companion's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
sketch, here annexed, conveys a good idea. The
valley is bounded by ridges of no great elevation, partially
covered with a shrubbery of myrtle, cistus, and other such
underwood, among rocks and cliffs worn by the waters
into fantastic shapes. We occasionally crossed spurs of
these ridges, commanding extensive views of the Straits of
Bonifacio, with the mountains of Corsica in the distance
on the one hand, and the nearer island of Madelena on the
other.</p>

<p>Nearly all the province of Gallura, washed by the
Mediterranean on three sides, consists of mountainous
tracts, with valleys intervening, similar to this of the Liscia.
There is scarcely any cultivation, and they are uninhabited;
almost all the towns and villages of the Capo di Sopra
lying on the coast. On these plains a few shepherds lead
a nomad life during the healthy season, being driven from
them by the deadly <i>intemp&eacute;rie</i> prevailing in summer and
autumn. Until lately, the whole district was notorious for
the crimes of robbery and vindictive murder, for the perpetration
of which, and the security of the offenders, its
solitudes and natural fastnesses afforded the greatest
facilities.</p>

<p>Continuing our route we crossed some park-like glades,
with scattered forest trees, and fringed by the graceful
shrubbery, the <i>macchia</i>, common to both the islands of
Corsica and Sardinia. At some distance on our left (south-east)
appeared a beautifully wooded hill, with a chapel on
the summit, Santa Maria di Arsachena, one of the sanctuaries
held in great veneration by the Gallurese. To these
holy places they flock in great numbers on certain festivals,
when the lonely spots, often hill-tops, surrounded by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
most wild and romantic scenery, witness devotions and
festivities, to which the revels form the chief allurement.</p>

<p>There is a still holier place further to the south of our
track, the Monte Santo, and I think its lofty summit, with
a small chapel scarcely visible amid the dark verdure of
the surrounding woods, was pointed out to us. It overhangs
the village of Logo Santo, well described as the
&ldquo;Mecca of the Gallurese.&rdquo; The sanctity of the place was
established in the thirteenth century, the tradition being
that the relics of St. Nicholas and St. Trano, anchorites
and martyrs here <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 362, were discovered on the spot by
two Franciscan monks, led to Sardinia by a vision of the
Virgin Mary at Jerusalem. A village grew up round the
three churches then erected in honour of the Saints and
the Blessed Virgin, with a Franciscan convent, long
stripped of its endowments, and fallen to ruin.</p>

<p>On the occurrence of the festivals celebrated at these
holy places, the people of the neighbouring parishes assemble
in multitudes, marching in procession, with their
banners at their head; and the sacred flag of Tempio, surmounted
by a silver cross, is brought by the canons of the
cathedral and planted on the spot. The devotions are
accompanied by feasting, dancing, music, and sports, the
people prolonging the revels into the night, as many of
them come from far, and the festivals occupy more than
one day.</p>

<p>That Christian rites were, from very early times, blended
with festivities accordant to the national habits of the new
converts, with even some alloy of pagan usages, is understood
to have been a policy adopted by the founders of the
faith among semi-barbarous nations&mdash;a concession to the
weakness of their neophytes. Our own village wakes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
fairs, with their green boughs and flags, cakes and ale,
originally held in the precincts of the church on the feast-day
of the patron saint, partook of a similar character as
the festivals of the Gallurese; but with us the religious
element has been long extinct.</p>

<p>The festivals are not confined to the Gallura; they have
their stations throughout the island, every district having
some shrine of peculiar sanctity. Their celebration is
distinguished by some peculiarities, which, in common
with many other customs of the Sardes, and numerous
existing monuments and remains, leave no doubt of Sardinia
having been early colonised from the East. Traces
may also be found in the customs of the Sardes of similarity
with the Greek life and manners, derived indeed by
the Greeks from the same common source.</p>

<p>Thus the usages of the Sardes afford, in a variety of
instances, a living commentary, perhaps the best still
existing, on the modes of life and thought recorded in
Homer and the Bible. This they owe to their insular
position, their slight admixture with other races, and the
consequent tenacity with which they have adhered to their
primitive traditions.</p>

<p>Of some of these indications of origin we may take
occasion to treat hereafter, as they fall in our way. For
our present purpose may we not refer to the worship in
&ldquo;high places&rdquo; and in &ldquo;groves,&rdquo; to which the Sardes are so
zealously addicted, as a relic of practices often denounced
in the Old Testament, when the sacrifice was offered to
idols? They appear also to have been common and legitimate
in the patriarchal age and the earlier times of the Israelitish
commonwealth, Jehovah alone being the object of worship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
What more biblical, as far as the Old Testament is concerned,
than the idea that worship and prayer are more
acceptable to the Almighty when offered on certain spots,
holy ground, remote, perhaps, from the usual haunts of
the worshipper! What a living picture we have in the
festivities of the religious assemblies at Logo Santo and
Santa Maria di Arsachena, of the feasting and music, the
songs and dances accompanying the rites of Israelitish
worship in common with those of other eastern nations;
not to speak of the festive character of Greek solemnities,
derived, indeed, from the same source, vestiges of which,
left by the Hellenic colonies, may also be traced.</p>

<p>However contrary these ideas and practices may be to the
spirit and precepts of the Gospel, they are so inherent in
the genius and traditions of the Sarde people, that I have
heard it asserted that these festas give, at the present day,
almost the only vitality to the ecclesiastical system established
in the island. Their religious character has almost
entirely evaporated, though the forms remain. The
&ldquo;solemn meetings,&rdquo; instead of merely ending in innocent
merriment, have degenerated into scenes of riot, and often
of bloodshed.</p>

<p>I was informed by the same person who made the
remark that the festas were the main prop of the priesthood
in Sardinia&mdash;and a more competent observer could
not be found&mdash;that, from his own observation, men of the
most sober habits of life lost all command of themselves,
became absolutely frantic when tempted by the force of
example, and led by what may be called an instinctive
national passion to participate in these religious orgies.
And Captain Smyth, <span class="smcap">r.n.</span>, who gives an interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
account of one of these feasts, at which he was present<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>,
after mentioning that &ldquo;prayers, dances, poems, dinner,
and supper concluded [occupied] the day,&rdquo; remarks, &ldquo;that
the feast of Santa Maria di Arsachena has seldom been
celebrated without the sacrifice of three or four lives.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
year preceding my visit,&rdquo; he states, &ldquo;two of the carabiniere
reale had been killed; and I was shown a young
man who, on the same occasion, received a ball through
the breast, but having thus satisfied his foe according to
the Sarde code of honour, and fortunately recovering, was,
with his wife and a beautiful child, now enjoying the
gaieties of the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Smyth adds:&mdash;&ldquo;I could not learn why there
were no carabineers in attendance on this anniversary;
but the consequence was a numerous concourse of banditti
from the circumjacent fastnesses, notwithstanding the
presence of a great many &#8216;barancelli,&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> who, it is known,
will not arrest a man that is only an assassin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The themes suggested by wayside objects have led us
away from our track, and we have still a long and rugged
road to Tempio. We shall be in the saddle for hours after
sunset. Let us devote another chapter to the continuation
of our journey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>After following the course of the Liscia for about an
hour, we struck up a lateral valley, the water of which
stood in pools, separated by pebbly shallows, but overhung
by drooping willows, and fringed with a luxuriant
growth of ferns and rank weeds. The hills were covered
with dense woods, intersected by rare clearings and inclosures
on their slopes. Here and there stood a solitary
<i>stazza</i>, as the stations or homesteads of the few resident
farmers are here called. We observed that they were
generally fixed on rising ground. At some of these the
courier stopped, his errands consisting not in the delivery
of letters, that office appearing to be a sinecure in this
wild track, but in leaving packets of coffee, sugar, &amp;c.,
and, in one instance, a cotton dress,&mdash;commodities none
of which had probably been taxed to the Customs at
La Madelena.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>The valley narrowed, and its water quickened into a
lively trout stream, gurgling over a rocky bed, bordered
on one side by thick underwood, feathering down to its
edge. The myrtles here were thirty feet high, and,
blended with the tall heath (Erica arborea), the branching
arbutus, the cistus, lentiscus, with scores of other shrubs,
formed thickets of as exquisite beauty as any we had seen
in Corsica. The stream on its hither bank washed a narrow
margin of grass beneath the woods. Here we rested our
horses and dined. Wayfarers in such countries generally
select the right spot for their halt. This was a delightful
one, and we fared well enough on the contents of a basket
provided at La Madelena. Such rough <i>al fresco</i> meals,
the uncertainty when you will get another, even when
and where your ride will end, the living in the present,
with fresh air and sunshine, and perpetual though
gradual change of scene, with the absence of all care
about the future&mdash;these form the charms of such travelling
as ours.</p>

<p>Again in the saddle, we soon afterwards entered a forest
of magnificent cork trees, festooned with wild vines,
relieving the sombre tints of the forest by the bright
colours of their fading leaves. It hung on a mountain's
side, and the gloomy depth of shade became deeper and
deeper, as, after a while, the dusk of evening came on,
and we began to thread the gorges which led to the summit
of the pass.</p>

<p>Salvator Rosa himself might have studied the wild
scenery of Sardinia to advantage. If I recollect right, we
are informed that he did. Nor would it require much
effort of the imagination to add life to the picture in forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
suited to its savage aspect,&mdash;to conjure up the grim
bandit bursting from the thickets on his prey, or lurking
behind the rock for the hour of vengeance on his enemy.
Such scenes are by no means imaginary.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">A SALVATOR ROSA SCENE.</p>
</div>

<p>Even now, numbers of the <i>fuorusciti</i> find shelter in the
fastnesses of the Gallura; the remnant of bands once so
formidable that they spread terror through the whole province,
bidding defiance alike to the law and the sword.
Only within the present century the government has succeeded
in quelling their ferocity, but not without desperate
resistance to the troops employed, eighty of whom were
destroyed by a party of the bandits in a single attack.</p>

<p>Still, though a better spirit begins to prevail, and outrages
have become less common and flagrant, we found,
in travelling through the island, a prevailing sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
insecurity quite incompatible with our ideas of the
supremacy of law under a well-ordered government. Some
of the mountainous districts were in so disturbed a state
that we were cautioned not to approach them; and every
one we met throughout our journey was armed to the teeth.</p>

<p>For ourselves, we felt no apprehensions, and took no
precautions. In the first place, we were not to be easily
frightened by possible dangers; and, in the second, we
knew that a peaceable guise, in the character of foreign
travellers, was our best protection. The violences of the
<i>fuorusciti</i> are, it is well understood, mingled and tempered
with a strong sense of honour. I imagine, indeed, that
they originate for the most part in that principle, developed
in <i>vendetta</i>, though degenerating into rapine and
robbery. Outlaws must find means of subsistence as well
as honest men, and are not likely to be very scrupulous as
to the mode of obtaining them. Among such characters
there will be miscreants capable of any crime, and therefore
there is always danger. But, still, the virtue of
hospitality to strangers, so inherent amongst the Sardes, as
in most semi-barbarous races, is not extinguished in hearts
which are hardened against every other feeling of humanity.
As the stranger is secure when he has &ldquo;eaten salt&rdquo; in the
tent of the Bedouin, the Caffre's kraal, or the wigwam of
the Red Indian, so there are numerous instances of the
Sarde outlaws having afforded shelter and assistance to
strangers throwing themselves on their honour and hospitality.
Mr. Warre Tyndale relates such an adventure by
a friend of his. We will venture to give the details.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In passing over the mountains from Tempio to Longone
he fell in with five or six <i>fuorusciti</i>, who, after the
usual questions, finding that he was a stranger in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
country, offered to escort him a few miles on his road, for
&#8216;security.&#8217; According to his story of the occurrence, he
could not at all comprehend the meaning of their expression;
for the fact of finding himself completely at the
mercy of six men, any one of whom might, could, or would
in an instant have deprived him of life, gave him very
different ideas as to the meaning of the word. In thanking
them for their offer he elicited their interpretation of the
phrase, and was not a little amused and comforted by
their assurance that the proffered security consisted in
delivering him safely into the hands of the very party with
whom they were waging deadly warfare. &#8216;<i>Incidit in
Scyllam qui vult vitare Charybdim</i>,&#8217; thought my friend;
but having no alternative he accepted their offer, and,
after partaking of an excellent breakfast with them, they
all proceeded onwards. For three hours they continued
their slow and cautious march through defiles to which he
was a perfect stranger; and while in conversation with
them on matters totally unconnected with the dangers of
the place, they made a sudden and simultaneous halt.
Closing in together, a whispering conference ensued among
them, and as my friend was excluded from it, he began to
suspect he had been ensnared by the offer of escort, and
that the fatal moment had arrived when he was to fall
their dupe and victim. His suspicions were increased by
seeing one of the party ride forward, and leave his companions
in still closer confabulation; but the suspense,
though painful, was short, for in a few minutes the envoy
returned, and an explanation of their mysterious halt and
secrecy took place. It appeared that the keen eyes and
ears of his friends had perceived their foes, who were concealed
in the adjoining wood, and that, having halted, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
of them had gone as ambassador with a flag of truce and
negotiated an armistice for his safe escort. My friend
parted from his first guard of banditti with all their blessings
on his head, and having traversed a space of neutral
ground, was received by the second with no less kindness,
and treated with no less honourable protection. They
accompanied him till he was safely out of their district,
assuring him that his accidental arrival and demand on
their mutual honour and hospitality did not at all interfere
with their dispute and revenge; and that if they were
to meet each other the day after they had discharged the
duty of safely escorting him, they would not be deterred
by what had happened from instantaneously shedding each
others' blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This scene,&rdquo; adds Mr. Warre Tyndale<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, &ldquo;took place in
the forest of Cinque-Denti, or &#8216;five-teeth,&#8217; a tract of several
miles in extent, said to contain upwards of 100,000,000
trees and shrubs, principally oak, ilex, and cork, with an
underwood of arbutus and lentiscus; and such is the thickness
of the foliage, that the sunbeams and the foot of man
are said never to have entered many parts of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another instance of the honourable feeling and forbearance
hospitably shown by the Sarde mountaineer outlaws,
under circumstances of great temptation to plunder, was
related to me by a friend long resident in the island, as
having occurred in his own experience.</p>

<p>Not many years ago, he was passing through the wild
district in the defiles of which we have just described ourselves
as being engaged. My friend had a considerable
sum of money in his possession, more, he remarked, than he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
should have liked to lose. &ldquo;<i>Cantabit vacuus coram latrone
viator</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A traveller who meets robbers with his purse
empty may hope to escape scot free.&rdquo; That was not my
friend's case when he fell in with a party of outlaws armed
to the teeth. The rencontre was not very pleasant, but
putting the best face on it, he replied to their inquiries
&ldquo;whither he was bent,&rdquo; that he was in search of <i>them</i>;
knowing that they were in the neighbourhood, and would
give him shelter, as night was approaching, and on the
morrow put him on his way, which he had lost. This
appeal to their best feelings had the desired effect. Pleased
with my friend's assurance of the confidence he placed in
them, the outlaws conducted him to their place of refuge,
treated him with the best they had, and, next morning,
escorted him to the high-road, where they parted from
him with good wishes for the prosecution of his journey.
&ldquo;These men must have known,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;from
the weight of my valise, which they handled, that I had a
large sum of money with me. It was no less than 600<i>l.</i>&rdquo;
The weight of such an amount of <i>scudi</i> could not have
escaped their notice.</p>

<p>Pages might be filled with tales of the secret assassinations
and wholesale butcheries perpetrated, at no very
distant period, by the <i>malviventi</i> who swarmed in the
woods and mountains of Sardinia; of deadly feuds in which
families, and sometimes whole villages, were involved with
an implacable thirst for revenge; of places sacked, and of
travellers murdered and plundered in lone defiles. Some
instances of a generous sympathy for adversaries in distress,
and more of a gallantry displayed by some of the
bandits which would have graced a better cause, might
serve to relieve the dark shades of these pictures. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
enough of this kind has found a place in our chapters on
Corsica. I prefer relating a story which may leave on the
mind pleasing recollections of the Robin Hoods of the
Sardinian wilds. My friend, lately mentioned, who is
universally esteemed and respected by all classes of the
Sardes throughout the island, has been thrown by circumstances
into communication with the better sort of outlaws,
and occasionally been the medium of communication
between them and the Sardinian authorities, to their
mutual advantage. He has thus acquired considerable
influence over those unhappy men, enjoying their full
confidence, without which the circumstances I am about
to relate could not have occurred.</p>

<p>It appeared that, not very long since, my friend had
kindly undertaken to conduct an English party from La
Madelena to Tempio, the same route on which we are now
engaged. The party consisted of an officer and his lady,
and I believe some others. The lady was fond of sketching;
attractive subjects, we know, are not wanting, and the
indulgence of her taste caused frequent delays on the road,
notwithstanding my friend's repeated warnings of the ill
repute in which that district was held in consequence of
its proximity to the haunts of the banditti. Of all things
the tourists would have rejoiced to have seen a real bandit,
but, probably, under any other circumstances than in a
wild pass of the Gallura mountains. So when the shades
of night were closing in, as they do very soon after sunset
in southern latitudes, and the party became apprehensive
that they should be benighted in those dreary solitudes,
there was considerable alarm:&mdash;what was to be done?</p>

<p>My friend, having politely suggested that he had not
been remiss in pointing out the consequences of delay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
replied that they must make for shelter in some <i>stazza</i>,
which they might possibly reach. Accordingly he led the
way by a rough track through dusky thickets, and after
pursuing it for some time, great was the joy of his companions
at discovering a house, where they were received
with great hospitality, and the promise of all the comforts
a mountain farm could offer.</p>

<p>The ladies had thrown aside their travelling equipments,
the table was spread, and, congratulating themselves on
having found such an asylum, the party sat down to
supper, in all the hilarity which their escape from the
perils and inconveniences of a night spent in the forest
was calculated to promote. The occurrence was regarded
as one of those unexpected adventures which give a zest to
rough travelling.</p>

<p>While, however, their gaiety was at the highest, it was
interrupted by loud knocking at the house door, and
hoarse voices were heard without, demanding immediate
admittance. A short consultation took place between my
friend and their host, who agreed that no resistance could
be offered, that the door should be opened, and they must
all submit to their fate. Then the banditti rushed in with
fierce gestures; truculent men, with shaggy hair and
beards, wrapped in dark <i>capotes</i>, with long guns in their
hands, and daggers in their belts and bosoms. &ldquo;Spare
our lives, and take our money, and all that we have,&rdquo; was
the cry of some of the travellers. Nor were the bandits
slow in falling upon the <i>sacs</i> and <i>malles</i>, and beginning
to rummage their contents, without, however, offering the
slightest molestation to any of the party, who stood aghast
witnessing their movements.</p>

<p>So far from it, suddenly, as if by a concerted signal, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
outlaws, relinquishing their booty, throw off their dark
mantles, disclosing all the bravery of the picturesque
costume of Gallurese mountaineers, and grouping themselves
round the table, leaned on the slender barrels
of their fusils with a proud expression of countenance
which seemed to say:&mdash;&ldquo;We are outlaws, indeed; but
we hold sacred the laws of hospitality and honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The travellers found that they were safe, and, recovering
from their panic, finished their supper with renewed
gaiety. The outlaws withdrew, but shortly returning,
some of them accompanied by their wives and children
<i>en habits de f&ecirc;te</i>, the evening was spent in the exhibition
of national dances, with songs and merriment.</p>

<p>This formed the concluding scene in the little drama
which my informant had got up for the gratification of
his friends. Travellers might naturally wish to see specimens
of a race so unique and so celebrated as the Corsican
and Sardinian bandits, if they could do so with impunity,
just as they would a lion or a tiger uncaged and in his
native woods, from a safe point of view. My informant
was able to gratify his friends at the expense of a temporary
fright. Perhaps they might have been better
pleased if the &ldquo;<i>Deus ex machin&acirc;</i>&rdquo; had not appeared to
disclose the plot, and they had been suffered to consider
the happy <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> as the natural result of the outlaws'
magnanimity. Such, by all accounts, it might have
been.</p>

<p>But I can assure my readers that it requires a stout
heart, and a strong faith in what one has heard of the
redeeming qualities in the outlaws' character, to meet
them in the open field without shuddering. It was in the
dusk of early morning, that, soon after leaving a village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
on the borders of the Campidano, where we had passed
the night, we suddenly fell in with a party of ten or twelve
of these men, who crossed our track making for the hills.
They were mounted on small-sized horses, stepping lightly
under the great weight they carried; for the bandits were
stalwart men, and heavily accoutred. Their guns were,
variously, slung behind them, held upright on the thigh,
or carried across the saddle-bows; short daggers were
stuck in each belt, and a longer one hung by the side; a
large powder-horn was suspended under the arm. Saddles
<i>en pique</i>, with sheepskin housings, and leathern pouches
attached on both sides, supplying the place of knapsack
and haversack, completed the equipment. The &ldquo;cabbanu,&rdquo;
a cloak of coarse brown cloth, hung negligently from the
shoulders, and underneath appeared the tight-fitting pelisse
or vest of leather; and the loose white linen drawers,
which give the Sardes a Moorish appearance, were gathered
below the knee underneath a long black gaiter tightly
buckled.</p>

<p>Already familiar with the garb and equipments of a
Sarde mountaineer, these details were caught at a glance.
The gaze was riveted on the features of these desperate
men,&mdash;the keen black eyes flashing from their swarthy
countenances, to which a profusion of hair, falling on the
shoulders from beneath the dark <i>berette</i>, gave, with their
bushy beards, a ferocious aspect;&mdash;and, above all, the
resolute but melancholy cast of features which expressed
so well their lot of daring&mdash;and despair.</p>

<p>Whether the party was bent on a plundering raid, or
returning from some terrible act of midnight murder,
there was nothing to indicate; but the impression was
that they were the men &ldquo;to do or die&rdquo; in whatever enterprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
they were engaged. The party kept well together,
riding in single file with almost military precision. Their
pace was steady, with no appearance of haste, though they
must probably have been aware that some carabineers
were stationed in the place hard by, which we had just left.
It was a startling apparition,&mdash;these &ldquo;children of the
mist&rdquo;&mdash;sweeping by us in grim cavalcade over a wild
heath, in the cold grey dawn of a November day, every
hand stained with blood, every bosom steeled to vengeance.
They took no notice of us, though we passed them closely,
not even exchanging salutations with our <i>cavallante</i>. We
gazed on them till they were out of sight.</p>

<p>No such thoughts as those suggested by the occurrences
just related occupied our minds while we ascended the
defile which penetrates the mountain chain intervening
between Tempio and the valleys terminating on the coast.
The savage character and the traditions of the locality
might have inspired them, but we were under the protection
of the courier, a privileged person&mdash;probably for
good reasons,&mdash;and, besides this, as I have already said,
under no sort of personal apprehension. Our attention
was divided between the stern magnificence of the gorge,
the more striking from its being now half veiled in darkness,
and the difficulties of the ascent which, as usual,
increased step by step, until, at last, winding stairs cut in
the rock surmounted the highest cliffs and landed us at
the summit of the pass.</p>

<p>On emerging from the gloomy defile, there was a total
change of scene. We found ourselves on open downs,
apparently of great extent, with a flood of light shed over
them by a bright moon, and two brilliant planets in the
south-west, pointing like beacon lights to the position of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Tempio. An easy descent of the sloping downs brought
us to the level of a vast elevated plateau, extending, with
slight undulations, and broken by only one rocky ridge, to
the vicinity of the town. When at the summit of the
pass, we had still eight or ten miles to accomplish. Late
as it was, the ride would have been highly enjoyable, in
that pure atmosphere, with the vault of heaven blazing
overhead, and the stillness of the night broken only by
our horses' hoofs, but for the weariness of the poor beasts
after a long day's journey and the toilsome ascent of a
mountain pass, and the ruggedness of the tracks along
which we had to pick our way.</p>

<p>Welcome, therefore, were the lights of Agius, Luras, and
Nuches, villages standing some little way out of the road,
at from two to three miles' distance from Tempio. These
places, Agius in particular, were formerly notorious for robbery
and vendetta, notwithstanding which the population,
which is chiefly pastoral, has always maintained a high character
for kindness, hospitality, industry, and temperance.</p>

<p>Our path lay now through very narrow lanes, dividing
vineyards and gardens, extending all the way to Tempio.
The replies of the courier to our inquiries after a hotel
had left a complete blank in our prospects of bed, board,
and lodging at the end of our journey. For travellers,
such as ourselves, there was no accommodation. Tempio
was rarely visited by strangers. This looked serious, after
a mountain ride of nearly thirty miles, and between nine
and ten o'clock at night;&mdash;what was to be done? We
had letters of introduction to persons of the highest distinction
in the place, but they hardly warranted our
intruding ourselves on them, hungry, travel-stained, and
houseless, at that late hour. The case, however, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
desperate we decided, at last, on presenting ourselves to
the Commandant of the garrison, as the most likely person
to give or procure us quarters.</p>

<p>The horses' feet clattered sharply on the <i>pav&eacute;</i> in the
stillness of the narrow deserted streets; and the huge
granito-built houses overhanging them, gloomy at all
hours, appeared doubly inhospitable now that all lights
were extinguished, the doors closed, and none ready to be
opened at the call of weary travellers. Thus we traversed
the whole city, the Commandant's mansion lying at the
furthest extremity. Our tramp roused to attention a
drowsy sentry at the gate; there were lights <i>&agrave; la prima</i>&mdash;the
family then had not retired for the night. The
strange arrival is announced, and our <i>viandante</i> makes no
scruple of depositing our baggage in the hall. The Commandant
receives us with politeness, regrets that he is so
straitened in his quarters that he cannot offer us beds,
and sends an orderly who procures us a lodging, meanwhile
giving us coffee. Attended by two soldiers, carrying our
baggage, we retrace our steps to the centre of the town,
and take possession of very sorry apartments, the best
portion of a gaunt filthy house. We are installed by the
mistress, a shrewish person, who, making pretensions to
gentility, receives her guests under protest that she does
not keep a hotel, but is willing to accommodate strangers,&mdash;a
phrase repeated a hundred times while we were under
her roof, and emphatically when presenting a rather unconscionable
bill on our departure. And this was the
only refuge in a city of from six to eight thousand inhabitants,
many of them boasting nobility, the capital of a
province, the seat of a governor and a bishop, and head-quarters
of a military district. I may be pardoned for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
being circumstantial in details giving an idea of what
travelling in Sardinia is. Things are much the same
throughout the island. The tourist who sets foot on it
must be steeled against brigands, vermin, <i>intemp&eacute;rie</i>, and
indifferent fare. &ldquo;<i>Per aspera tendens</i>&rdquo; would be his
suitable motto. He must be prepared to rough it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Unpropitious as first appearances were, we found no want
of real hospitality and kindness among the Tempiese, and
I have seldom spent a few days more pleasantly in a
provincial town. Daylight, indeed, failed to improve the
internal aspect of the place, but rather disclosed the filth
of the narrow streets, without entirely dissipating the
gloom shed upon them from the dusky granite of which
the buildings are constructed, and the heavy wooden
balconies protruding over the thoroughfares. The houses
have, however, a substantial air, some of them are stuccoed,
and Tempio can even boast its palaces of an ancient
nobility, with coats of arms sculptured in white marble
over the entrances. It possesses not less than thirteen
churches, of which the collegiate and cathedral church of
St. Peter is the only one worth notice,&mdash;a large and
lofty building of a mixture of styles, with some tawdry
ornaments, but a handsome high altar and well carved
oak stalls in the choir. The foundation consists of a dean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
and twelve canons, with eighteen other inferior clergy.
Since 1839 it has ranked as a cathedral, Tempio having
been erected into a see united with those of Civit&agrave; and
Ampurias, and the bishop residing here six months of the
year. There is a massive old nunnery, now, I believe,
suppressed, in the centre of the place, and outside the
town a reformatory for the confinement of criminals
sentenced to secondary punishment, a large building with
a handsome elevation.</p>

<p>A finer position for a large city, of greater importance
than Tempio, can scarcely be imagined. Placed on a
gentle swell of the wide undulating plain already mentioned&mdash;the
Gemini plain,&mdash;a plateau of nearly 2000 feet
above the level of the sea, it stands midway between two
grand mountain ranges, the Limbara stretching the bold
outlines of its massive forms in a course south of the town,
its summit rising to 4396 feet; and, to the north-east, a
chain not quite so elevated, but of an equally wild and
irregular formation, and presenting to the eye, when
viewed from Tempio, even a more rugged and serrated
ridge. The defiles of this chain we passed in approaching
Tempio; those of the Limbara were to be penetrated in
our progress southward.</p>

<p>Its high situation and exposure render Tempio healthy,
and it is even said to be cold in winter, of which we found
no symptoms in the month of November, when Limbara
is supposed to assume its diadem of snow, retaining it till
April.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/296.jpg" width="700" height="249" alt="THE LIMBARA, FROM TEMPIO."
title="THE LIMBARA, FROM TEMPIO." />
<p class="caption">THE LIMBARA, FROM TEMPIO.</p>
</div>

<p>I hardly recollect anything finer of its kind than the
panoramic view of the country between Tempio and the
mountains on either side, as seen from its terraces. It
combined great breadth, striking contrasts, and a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
harmonious blending of colour. For a wide circuit round
the town, gardens, orchards, vineyards, and a variety of
small inclosures, occupying the slopes and hollows of the
undulating surface, and well massed, give an idea of
fertility one should not expect at this elevation. Here
and there, a single round-topped pine, or a group of such
pines, crowns a knoll, and breaks the flowing outlines. The
open pastoral country beyond is linked to this cultivated
zone by detached masses of copse and woods of cork and
ilex, extending to the base of the mountains.</p>

<p>The Tempiese are a hardy and industrious people,
exhibiting their spirit of activity in the careful cultivation
about the town and the occupations of vast numbers of
the population as shepherds, <i>cavallanti</i>, or <i>viandanti</i>. The
dull town also shows some signs of life by a considerable
trade in the country produce of cheese, fruits, hams,
bacon, &amp;c. They manufacture here the best guns in
Sardinia, and know how to use them; being capital sportsmen,
<i>cacciatori</i>, as well as formidable enemies in the
vindictive feuds for which they have been celebrated, and
not yet entirely extinct. A short time ago, two factions
fought in the streets, and, though the bloody strife was
quelled, they are said still to eye each other askance.
Returning one night from the Casino, in company of the
Commandant, he stopped on the piazza in front of the
cathedral and related to us the circumstances of an
assassination perpetrated a short time before on the very
steps of the church.</p>

<p>The office of viceroy of Sardinia having been abolished,
each of the eleven provinces into which the island is divided,
the principal being Cagliari, Oristano, Sassari, and Tempio
including the whole of Gallura, is administered by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
<i>Intendente</i>, who communicates directly with the Ministers
at Turin. The military districts correspond with the civil
divisions of the island. We found two companies of the
line, and a squad of <i>carabinieri</i>, mounted gendarmes,
stationed at Tempio. Sardinia returns twenty-four members
to the national parliament at Turin. The ecclesiastical
jurisdiction is administered by three archbishops, filling
the sees of Cagliari, Sassari, and Oristano, and eight
bishops, seated in the other principal cities.</p>

<p>High official appointments at Tempio are not very
enviable posts; governors and commandants not being
exempt from the summary vengeance, for real or supposed
wrongs, at which the Sardes are so apt. The Commandant
told us that his immediate predecessor had received one of
the death-warnings which precede the fatal stroke: I
believe he was soon afterwards removed. For himself, his
successor said, he took no precautions, did his duty, and
braved the consequences. A few years before, the Governor,
having compromised himself by acts of injustice, was
assassinated, after receiving one of these &ldquo;death-warnings&rdquo;
peculiar to Sardinia. &ldquo;During the night he heard a pane
of glass crack, and on examining it in the morning he
found the fatal bullet on the floor. The custom of the
country is that, whenever the <i>vendetta alla morte</i>, revenge
even to death, is to be carried out, the party avenging himself
shall give his adversary timely notice by throwing a
bullet into his window, in order that he may either make
immediate compensation for the injury or prepare himself
for death. The Governor for some time used every
caution as to when and where he went, but at length
disregarded the warning, imagining he was safe. The
assassin, however, had watched him with an eagle's eye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and he fell in a moment he least expected. Report further
says,&rdquo; observes Mr. Tyndale, in whose words we relate the
occurrence, &ldquo;that he is not the only Governor of Gallura
to whom this summary mode of obtaining justice, or
inflicting vengeance, has been intimated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The present Intendente of Tempio, the Marchese
Clavarino, though he only entered on his office in the
month of April before our visit, had already done much
by his firm and enlightened administration to restore
order and confidence. He had been able to collect the
arrears of taxes, and, by impartial justice between all
factions, had removed every pretence for a resort to deeds
of violence for the redress of injuries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Governor's palace, establishment, and retinue,&rdquo;
observes Mr. Tyndale, &ldquo;consist of three rooms on a
second story, a female servant, and a sentry at the door.&rdquo;
Things were little changed in 1853, but, in the absence of
all state, we were impressed on our first visit of ceremony
that the government of a turbulent province could not
have been intrusted to better hands. In the antechamber
we found a priest waiting, as it struck me from his deportment,
to prefer his suit with &ldquo;bated breath,&rdquo; and the
feeling that the wings of the priesthood are now clipped in
the Sardinian states. The Marquis conversed with frankness
on his own position and the state of the island. He
had been in London at the time of the &ldquo;Great Exhibition,&rdquo;
and his views of the English alliance, and of politics
generally, were just such as might be expected from an
enlightened Sardinian. A worthy coadjutor to such
statesmen as D'Azeglio and Cavour, I would venture to
predict that the Intendente of Tempio will ere long be
called to fill a higher post.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Our rambles in the environs of Tempio were very
pleasant. It was the season of the vintage, late here; and
great numbers of the people were busily employed in the
vineyards and the &ldquo;lodges&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> attached to them. Observing
smoke issuing from most of these, we learned, in answer to
our inquiries, that a portion of boiled lees is added in the
manufacture of wine, to insure its keeping, the grapes not
sufficiently ripening in consequence of the coldness of the
climate. We found no such fault with those we tasted.
A very considerable extent of surface is planted with vines,
divided, however, into small vineyards. At the entrance
of each stands an arched gateway, generally a solid structure
of granite, with more or less architectural pretensions,
and a date and initials carved in stone, commemorative,
no doubt, of the planting of so cherished a family inheritance.
One of these is represented in the foreground of
the accompanying plate.</p>

<p>There are several fountains in the neighbourhood of
Tempio, the waters of which are deliciously cool and pure.
One of them, on the road beyond the Commandant's house,
gushes out of the rock, under shade of some fine Babylonian
willows. Sheltered by these in the heat of noon,
and in still greater numbers at eventide, one saw the damsels
of Tempio resort with their pitchers, as in ancient
times Abraham's steward, in his journey to Mesopotamia,
stood at the well of Nahor, when the daughters of the men
of the city came out with their pitchers<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>; as Saul, passing
through Mount Ephraim and ascending the hill of Zuph,
met the maidens going out to draw water<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>; or as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
spies of Ulysses fell in with the daughter of Antiphates at
the well of Artacia.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Sardinia abounds with such mementos
of primitive times.</p>

<p>The Tempiese women have the singular habit of raising
the hinder part of the upper petticoat, the <i>suncurinu</i>,
when they go abroad, and bringing it over the head and
shoulders, so as to form a sort of hood. So far from this
fashion giving them, as might be supposed, a <i>dowdy</i>
appearance, it is not inelegant when the garment is gracefully
arranged. It has generally broad stripes, and is often
of silk or a fine material. The under-petticoat, of cloth,
is either of a bright colour, or dark with a bright-coloured
border. Both of them are worn very full. The jacket is
of scarlet, blue, or green velvet, fitting very tightly to the
figure, the edges having a border of a different colour, and
sometimes brocaded. The simple head-dress consists of a
gaily-coloured kerchief wound round the head, and tied in
knots before and behind.</p>

<p>We expected to get some shooting in the woods at the
foot of the Limbara, as they abound with wild hogs,
<i>cingale</i>, and deer, <i>capreoli</i>, a sort of roebuck. Our letters
of introduction to some gentlemen of Tempio failed of
assisting us. They were from home, probably engaged in
the vintage. But the Sardes of all ranks are determined
sportsmen, <i>cacciatori</i>, and we did not despair, though
hunting excursions in the island require, as we shall find,
a certain organisation. In our dilemma we made the acquaintance&mdash;of
all people in the world&mdash;of a little barber,
who appeared deeply versed in the politics of the place,
and undertook to arrange the desired <i>chasse</i> with the Tempiese
hunters. We were to meet him the same evening, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
a low <i>caff&egrave;</i>, where he was to introduce us to the leaders of
the band. A singular conference it was, that meeting of
ourselves, men of the north, with the wild <i>chasseurs</i> of the
Gallura, between whom there was nothing in common but
enthusiastic love of the field and the mountain.</p>

<p>The low vault of the <i>Caff&egrave; de la Costituzione</i> was lighted
by a single lamp, by whose glimmerings we dimly discerned,
amidst wreaths of tobacco-smoke, the grim features
of the men with whom we had to do. They were honest
enough, no doubt, according to Sarde notions of honour,
and received us with great cordiality; but the consultation
between themselves was carried on in a patois quite unintelligible,
except that we gathered that there were some
difficulties in the way.</p>

<p><i>La caccia di cingale</i>, a boar-hunt in Sardinia, requires
a number of hunters, besides those who beat the woods to
rouse the game; and, whether there were any feuds to be
stifled, any jealousies to be allayed, which, with armed
men in that state of society, might endanger the peace,
the difficulties appeared serious. Whatever they were, our
<i>Barbi&egrave;re di Seviglia</i>, who, to use a familiar phrase, seemed
up to everything, and conducted the treaty on our part, did
not think proper to disclose them. One thing, however, we
soon learned, that the services of these men were not to be
hired; their ruling passion for the chase and the national
principle of hospitality were incentives enough to the proposed
expedition. We were also informed that there were
other parties to be consulted, and the meeting was adjourned
to the following day.</p>

<p>Very different was the scene at the Casino to which we
were introduced by the Commandant shortly after our consultation
with the hunters. At the Casino there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
<i>r&eacute;union</i> of the best society in Tempio every evening. We
found good rooms, well lighted, with coffee and refreshments
nicely served. There were newspapers, and a small
collection of books,&mdash;the standard works of Italian
writers, with some French. The society was unexpectedly
good for such a place as Tempio, consisting, besides the
officers of the garrison, of many of the resident nobles and
gentry. We spent some pleasant hours there, finding
among the members well-informed and intelligent persons.
Politics were freely discussed, liberal opinions prevailing
even to the degree of such ultra-liberalism as might have
better suited the class of persons we met at the <i>Caff&egrave; de la
Costituzione</i>, if politics are discussed there also. No doubt
they are, the Tempiese, like the rest of the islanders, being
a shrewd race, devotedly patriotic, and jealous of their
independence.</p>

<p>We could not, as already hinted, reckon Madame
Rosalie's <i>m&eacute;nage</i> among the pleasant things that reconciled
us to a longer stay than we intended in the rude
capital of Gallura; but, at least, she supplied us in her
own person with a fund of amusement. My companion,
who had the happy gift for a traveller of being almost
omnivorous, used to laugh heartily at my vain attempts to
extract something edible from the meagre <i>carte</i> offered by
Madame. Her replies parrying my demands, and uttered
with amazing volubility, in shrill tones and a patois almost
unintelligible, invariably ended to this effect:&mdash;&ldquo;Signore,
my house is not a locanda, though I have opened my
doors to accommodate you.&rdquo; It was a species of hospitality
that cost us dear. Madame's airs of gentility,
though very amusing, were of course treated with due
respect. But what gave zest to my friend's mirth, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
with the hopeless prospect of dinner, produced in me a
slight irritation, sometimes, perhaps, ill concealed, was
Madame Rosalie's evolutions on these occasions. I fancy,
now, that I see her slight figure skipping into the room,
dancing a jig round the table, never at rest, screeching all
the while at the highest pitch of her voice, with every
limb in motion, as if she had St. Vitus's dance, or, as they
say, went on wires. I can only compare the play of her
limbs to that of one of those children's puppets of which
all the limbs&mdash;head, legs, and arms&mdash;are set in motion
by pulling a string.</p>

<p>Nothing detained us at Tempio but the proposed boar-hunt.
We attended a second meeting of the principal
hunters, committing ourselves unreservedly to their disposal,
and, after some further consultation, among themselves,
our little barber had the glory of bringing the
negotiations to a successful issue. All the difficulties,
whatever they were, had been removed, and it was settled
that the affair should come off on the morrow.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at an early hour, there was an unusual
stir in the dull streets of Tempio, snapping of guns,
trampling of horses, and barking of dogs. On our joining
the party at the rendezvous in front of the <i>caff&egrave;</i>, we found
some twenty horsemen, carrying guns,&mdash;rough and ready
fellows, looking as if a dash into the forest, whether
against hogs or gendarmes, would equally suit them. We
were followed by a rabble on foot, attended by dogs of a
variety of species, some of them strong and fierce. After
winding through the narrow lanes among the vineyards,
our cavalcade was joined by one of the gentlemen on
whom we had called with a letter of introduction, and his
son, who mixed freely with our rank and file. There is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
happy fellowship in field sports which, to a great degree,
levels for the time distinctions of rank; and this we found
particularly in Sardinia, where all classes are so devoted to
these sports, and they are of a character requiring extended
and rather promiscuous operations.</p>

<p>Our irregular cavalry shaped their march in broken
order towards a spur of the mountains, covered with dense
thickets, at the foot of the Punta Balestiere, the highest
point of the Limbara. After clearing the inclosures our
track led us over the wide undulating plain already
described, interspersed with scattered thickets, but with
few signs of cultivation. On approaching the mountains
there were indications giving promise of sport in patches
of soil grubbed up by the wild hogs in search for the root
of the Asphodel, which they greedily devour. This handsome
plant springs from a bunch of long fibrous bulbs,
something like the Dahlia, throwing up straight stems two
or three feet high, with numerous angular filiformed leaves
and yellow flowers.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It grows freely on all the wastes
throughout the island. The root contains so large a
portion of saccharine matter, and is so plentiful, that while
we were in Sardinia a Frenchman was forming a company
for distilling alcohol from it on an extensive scale. A
distillery was to be established at Sassari, with moveable
stills throughout the island, wherever the bulbs could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
most easily procured. The projector gave us a sample-bottle
of the alcohol, a strong and purely tasteless spirit.
I heard afterwards that the speculation did not succeed.
There is fine feeding for the wild hogs, in season, on the
acorns of the vast cork and other oak woods in the interior
of the island, where we afterwards hunted them. They
commit great ravages in the cultivated grounds. One was
shot in the vineyards skirting the town during our stay at
Tempio.</p>

<p>Approaching the mountains we threw off our attendants
on foot, with their mongrel pack, whose business it was to
scale the wooded ridge from behind, and beat the thickets
for the game. The rest of our party soon afterwards
struck up a valley parallel with the ridge, and facing the
mountain side, which rose above it a vast amphitheatre of
hanging woods, shelving and precipitous cliffs, rocks and
pinnacles,&mdash;so glorious a spectacle that it riveted my
attention, and almost drew it off from the work before
us. But now our leaders proceeded to &ldquo;tell off&rdquo; the
party, stationing them singly at distances of about seventy
or eighty paces along the bottom of the valley, within
gunshot of the verge of the wood, which sloped to it. In
this open order the line extended more than half a mile.
The horses were tethered in the rear.</p>

<p>It was my lot to be posted near the extreme right on a
detached rock, slightly elevated, so as to command the
ground. I could just distinguish my neighbours on either
hand, &ldquo;low down in the broom,&rdquo; the valley being rather
thickly covered with brakes of underwood. The instructions
for my noviciate in boar-hunting were,&mdash;not to quit
my post, and to maintain strict silence; injunctions not
likely to be disregarded, as a breach of the former might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
have exposed me to be winged, in mistake for a pig
among the rustling bushes, considering that there were
dead shots on either flank, with two or three balls in their
barrels. As to the other word of order, silence, the
injunction was needless, for the ear of my nearest neighbour
could only have been reached by shouts which might
scare the game, and prevent their breaking cover, and
that I was not quite novice enough to risk.</p>

<p>So I sat down on the rock, with my gun across my
knees, watching the play of light and shade on the mountain
sides as the clouds flitted round them. But this did
not last long, for the line of <i>vedettes</i> could have been
scarcely formed when the shouts of the party who had
now gained the heights, and were beating the woods in
face of our position, summoned the hunters in the valley
beneath to be on the alert. The interval of suspense and
silence being now broken, the scene became very exciting.
The dogs in the wood gave tongue, and the short and
snapping bark was shortly followed by a full burst, which
told that the game was on foot. Then, no doubt, every
gun was at full cock, every eye intently watching the
avenues in the thickets through which boar or deer,
driven from the woods, might cross the valley. The
shouts and cries sounded nearer and nearer, till at length
a shot from the extreme left announced that some game
had been marked as it broke cover. A dropping fire now
extended at intervals along the line, as cingale or capreole
burst from the thickets. Several fell to the guns of the
party, some escaped; others, wounded, were pursued by
the dogs to the rear of the position, with a rush of some
of the hunters on their trail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>The thickets having been completely swept, the line was
now broken, and the party remounting their horses bore
their trophies to a woody glen, where we dined, the spot
chosen being the grassy bank of a little rivulet. Arms
were piled; some gathered wood and lighted fires, others
fetched water from the brook, and the more handy opened
the baskets of provisions we had brought from Tempio and
spread them on the grass. A wild boar was cut open, and,
in Homeric style, the choicest portions of the intestines
were torn out, and, broiled on wooden skewers, offered to
the hunting-knives of the guests. The wine cup went
round, and the hunters' feast was seasoned with rude
merriment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When they had eaten and drank enough,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> the party
mounted their horses and returned to Tempio, carrying
the game across their saddle-bows. The cavalcade was as
joyous as the feast. Jumping from their horses when they
got among the vineyards, some dashed over the fences and
brought away large bunches of grapes. And so we entered
the city in triumph. In the course of the evening the skin
of the finest wild boar was sent to our quarters as a trophy
of our share in the work of the day, with a joint of the
meat. Madame Rosalie's <i>cuisine</i> failed to do it justice;
but, when well cooked, wild boar is excellent eating. This
mode of hunting, generally practised by the Sardes, resembles
the <i>battue</i> of wolves and leopards at which I have
assisted in South Africa, where the Boers, assembling in
numbers, make an onslaught on the ravagers of their
flocks; having the dens and thickets driven, and stationing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
themselves on the outskirts with their long roers to shoot
down the vermin as they issue forth. Such meetings are
jovial, and the sport is exciting, but not to be compared,
I think, to deer-stalking or fox-hunting, to say nothing of
a foray against lions and tigers.</p>

<p>I have reason to believe from information received during
a recent visit to Sardinia that the insecurity which, to
some extent, prevailed when we were in the island in
1853, had considerably lessened. But while at Tempio in
that year we learnt by an official communication from
Cagliari that some of the central mountain districts,
through which we proposed to pass on a shooting excursion,
were in a disturbed state and must be approached with
caution. In consequence, the <i>Lascia portare arma</i> forwarded
to us was accompanied by an open order from the
Colonel commanding the royal Caribineers, addressed to all
the stations, for our being furnished with an escort. So,
also, on our visit of leave to the Intendente of Tempio he
pressed us to allow him to send us forward under escort,
though I did not learn that there had been any recent
outrages in his own province. On our declining the offer,
as at variance with our habits and feelings, the Intendente<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
said, &ldquo;I assure you that, here, the lowest government
employ&eacute; will not travel without an escort;&rdquo;&mdash;and he
again urged our accepting it, adding, &ldquo;the Marchese
d'Azeglio having put you under my especial protection, I
am responsible for your safety, and wish to use every precaution,
lest anything unpleasant should occur.&rdquo; On our
again respectfully declining the offer, the kind Intendente
said, with a shrug, &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, I have done my
duty, and I hope that when you get to Turin you will so
represent it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such precautions exhibit a singular state of society in
the midst of European civilisation; I apprehend, however,
that the Piedmontese officials, and the continentals in
general, paint the Sardes in darker colours than they
merit; and there is little good blood between them.</p>

<p>Having no such prejudices, and entertaining no apprehensions,
we started, as usual, having a honest viandante,
with his saddle and pack-horses, for our only escort. The
sun was just rising over the serrated ridge of the eastern
mountains, when, emerging from the fetid shade of the
narrow streets of Tempio, we came suddenly into his
blessed light. The mountain sides still formed an indistinct
mass of the richest purple hue, while, over the
whole plain beneath, light mists rolled in fantastic waves,
floating like a mysterious gauze-like veil, shreds of which
touched by the sun's rays became brilliantly coloured, and
others drifting through the scattered woods had the appearance
of being combed out into long and fine-spun threads
like the spiders'-webs which, gemmed with dew-drops,
hung from spray to spray. It was a magnificent view, of
great breadth, like one of Martin's mysterious pictures,
and seen under the most splendid effects; but so transitory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
that after we crossed the first ridge all was changed.
Meanwhile denser, but still light, wreaths close at hand
mingled with the mists, as the blue smoke curled up from
the vineyard sheds where the industrious Tempiese had
already commenced their labours. The temperature was
delicious, and rain had fallen in the night cooling the air
and refreshing vegetation. Pleasanter than ever was our
early ride through the pretty winding lanes dividing the
vineyards and gardens skirting the town, and again, as we
descended through deep banks among scattered woodlands
to the open plains extending to the foot of the Limbara
Mountains.</p>

<p>A long but easy ascent led to the top of the pass, the
ridge we mounted being thickly clothed with evergreen
shrubbery, the arbutus predominating, profusely decked
with fruit and flower. The summit of the pass opened to
us a double view in strong contrast. Looking back, we
once more saw through a gap the mountains of Corsica,
in faint outlines, eighty miles distant, with a glimpse of
a blue stripe of water, the Straits of Bonifacio. Turning
southward, we stood at the summit of a long winding glen
richly wooded with ilex and cork trees, and far away beneath
there lay before us a broad plain partially covered with
a sea of vapour, not like the gay wreaths of mist that
lightly floated over the elevated plateau surrounding
Tempio, but so still, so condensed, so white, as to have
been easily mistaken for a frozen lake powdered with snow,
and its hills for islands rising out of the water.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>But such an image is unsuited to the climate of Sardinia
at any season. Smiling as the landscape now appeared, its
most striking feature was associated with the idea of death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>That dense creamy vapour, formed by the pestiferous
exhalations of the lowlands, is the death shroud of the
plain outstretched beneath it.</p>

</div>

<p>During the heats of summer, nay, sometimes from April
till the latter end of November, the ravages of the deadly
<i>intemp&eacute;rie</i> extend throughout the island to such a degree
that in Captain Smyth's list of nearly 350 towns and
villages included in his &ldquo;Statistical Table of Sardinia,&rdquo;
full a third are noted as insalubrious. The disorder has
the same character as malaria, but is far more virulent.
Captain Smyth thus describes the symptoms: &ldquo;The
patient is first attacked by a headache and painful tension
of the epigastric region, with alternate sensations of heat
and chilliness; a fever ensues, the exacerbations of which
are extremely severe, and are followed by a mournful
debility, more or less injurious even to those accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
to it, but usually fatal to strangers.&rdquo; We have conversed
with natives and residents who have recovered from repeated
attacks of <i>intemp&eacute;rie</i>; foreigners suffer most.
&ldquo;Instances have been related to me,&rdquo; observes Captain
Smyth, &ldquo;of strangers landing for a few hours only from
Italian coasters, who were almost immediately carried off
by its virulence; indeed, the very breathing of the air by
a foreigner at night, or in the cool of the evening, is considered
as certain death in some parts.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Not twelve months before our visit, an English officer was
suddenly struck down and carried off while on a similar
excursion in this part of the island. Sir Harry Darrell
was one of the last men I should have thought liable to
so fatal an attack. A few years ago, when returning from
Caffreland just before the breaking out of the last war, I
met him on the march to the frontier. I had off-saddled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
at noon, and while my horses were grazing, knee-haltered,
on a slip of grass by the side of a running stream, was
lying under the shade of a wild olive-tree, when the head-quarters'
division of the &mdash;&#8212; Dragoon Guards passed along
the road. Sir Harry and some other officers rode down into
the meadow, and we talked of the state of Caffreland and
of the principal chiefs, most of whom I had recently seen.
I heard afterwards that he had got out fox-hounds and
hunted the country about Fort Beaufort. He was a keen
sportsman and clever artist. Some of his sketches in
South Africa were published by Ackerman. His remains
lie at Cagliari, where he was conveyed when struck by the
<i>intemp&eacute;rie</i>, dying a few days after. A friend of mine,
who was there at the time, informs me that Sir Harry's
constitution had become debilitated, and he had rendered
himself liable to the attack by exposure and over-fatigue.
I mention the circumstance as a warning, but do not think
there is much risk, with proper precautions, for men in good
health, through most parts of the island, after the November
rains have precipitated the miasma and purified the air.
We ourselves slept in most pestiferous places, where the
ravages of the disease were marked in the sallow countenances
of the inhabitants, without experiencing the least
inconvenience.</p>

<p>We rested at the summit of the pass commanding the
distant view of the Campidano, which led to these remarks
on the insalubrity of the country and the scourge of the
<i>intemp&eacute;rie</i>. They are not, however, confined to the plains,
but of course are more prevalent where marshes, stagnant
waters, and rank vegetation engender vapours rising in
the summer. Leaving my companion to finish the sketch
copied in a former page, I slowly trotted on with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
<i>viandante</i>, and, the descent becoming rapid, proceeded
leisurely down the wooded glen, a depth of shade in which
the heat, as well as the picturesque character of the
scenery, tempted to linger. Old cork and ilex trees, with
their rugged bark and grey foliage, throwing out rectangular
arms of stiff and fantastic growth, wild vines
hanging from the branches in festoons of brilliant hues,
other trees with tawny orange leaves,&mdash;I believe a species
of ash,&mdash;some of a rich claret, and the never-failing
arbutus, here quite a tree, with its orange and crimson
berries, all these massed together formed admirable contrasts
in shape and colour. And then there was the
gentle brook, never roaring or boisterous, but purling
among rocks dividing it into still pools, with giant ferns
hanging over the stream and bunches of hassock-grass
luxuriating in the alluvial soil of its little deltas, and,
where the forest receded, a graceful growth of shrubbery
feathering the winding banks.</p>

<p>Some of the cork-trees were fine specimens, of great age.
Several I measured in a rough way by embracing their
trunks with extended arms. This, repeated four or five
times, gave a circumference of twenty or twenty-five feet.
The bark was ten inches thick. While so employed I was
startled by a wild boar rushing by me into the thickets.
The cork wood gradually thinned into scattered clumps on
the slopes of the hills, and the winding valley, five or six
miles long, was abruptly terminated by a bold mamelon,
or green mound, covered with dwarf heath or turf; so
shorn and smooth it appeared, probably from being pastured,
in immediate contrast with the shaggy sides of the
mountain glen. The horsetrack, avoiding this obstacle,
led up the eastern acclivity of the glen, and the summit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
commanded the Campidano, now clear of fog, spread out
before us, far as the eye could reach, in a broad level,
broken only by some singular flat-topped hills in the foreground.</p>

<p>Striking and novel as this landscape appeared at the
first glance, I confess that, at the moment, my attention
was most directed backward on the track I had just
followed. It was now some hours since I parted from my
fellow-traveller. I had often listened for his horse's steps
in the deep glen, where there was no seeing many hundred
yards backwards or forwards; and though the present
elevation commanded some points in the track, he did not
appear. I was getting fidgetty, and the guide's replies
to my inquiries did not tend to reassure me, for there are
&ldquo;<i>malviventi</i>&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;<i>fuorusciti</i>&rdquo; in the wilds&mdash;a
well known distinction&mdash;when, just as we were on the
point of returning back, after half an hour's additional
suspense, I got a glimpse of my friend trotting out of the
woods close under the point of view. He, too, had lingered
in the romantic glen after finishing his sketch.</p>

<p>We had now cleared the defiles of the Limbara, and,
descending to the level of the plains, made up for lost time
by galloping <i>ventre &agrave; terre</i> over the boundless waste.
Here were no shady nooks, no forest masses, no fantastic
growths, no grey crags, no bright-flowered thickets, so
grouped as one might never see again, and tempting to
linger. All the features were now on a broad scale; they
were caught at a glance, and the few which broke the
monotony of the scene were repeated again and again.
But they were not without interest. The rivulet had expanded
into a wide stream, making long bends through
the deep loam of the grassy meads, and looking so cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and refreshing, that, but for the pebbly shoals in its bed,
it was difficult to conceive the midsummer heats rendering
these verdant plains desolate and pestilential.</p>

<p>Along the banks of the river, and far away in every
direction, were scattered herds of cattle, guarded by armed
shepherds, wild bearded fellows in goatskin mantles and
leather doublets, mostly on horseback. We meet such
figures on the grassy track, looking fiercely as we sweep
along; we see them at a distance on the edge of some of
the gentle slopes in which the plain is rolled, when only
the profile of the horse, the stalwart rider and his long
gun, comes out clear against the sky. There is more life
on the Campidano than in the mountains. Not that it is
inhabited; there is scarcely a house on this whole plain,
fifty or sixty miles in circumference. Not that there is
much cultivation; here and there, at rare intervals, we
see patches of a livelier green than the surrounding expanse
of grass, and the young wheat just springing up,
the strong blade and rich loamy furrow, remind us that
Sardinia was reckoned in former times a granary of Rome.
We see also the grey mounds of the Nuraghe scattered
over the plain, some mouldering down to its level, a few
still rearing their truncated cones, like solitary watch-towers,
for which they have been mistaken. They, too,
remind us of times long past, of a primitive age. But they
are to be found in all parts of the island, and we shall fall
in with them again, more at leisure to examine their
structure and hazard a conjecture as to their origin. Now
we gallop on over the level plain. The sward on the
beaten track is close and elastic, and our cavallante's
spirited barbs, spared in the glen during the noontide
heat, spring as if they had never been broken to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
<i>portante</i> pace. The morning fog and the cadaverous
features of the shepherds have warned us that the teeming
Campidano is no place to linger in after nightfall. Their
homes are in the villages scattered round the edge of the
great plain; not much elevated, as the <i>paese</i> in Corsica, but
standing on gentle acclivities. We marked them at a
distance. Already we have passed Sassu on our right and
Oschiri on our left; they are poor places. Codriaghe and
Codrongianus and Florinas stand at the extremity of the
plain towards Sassari, and we shall see them on our road
thither, if we ever get there. Ardara, once the capital of
the province of Logudoro, founded as early as 1060, and
having many historic traditions, crowns, with its massive
towers rising above the ruined walls, a hillock on the plain
right before us. It boasts also a fine church, enriched
with curious objects of art; but the town has dwindled
to a collection of hovels with a small population, few of
whom, we are told, survive their fiftieth year, so destructive
is the <i>intemp&eacute;rie</i>. We turn away: Ozieri stands
invitingly on rather a bold eminence at the head of a
gorge where the plain narrows towards the hills. The
rays of the setting sun are full upon its houses and
churches. It is a place of some importance, and lies in
our proposed line through byroads to the forest districts
of the interior. If our pace holds on we may reach it
by an hour after sunset. Perhaps we shall find good
cheer, the best preservative, I should imagine, against the
miasma that produces <i>intemp&eacute;rie</i>.</p>

<p>Vast open plains, such as that described in the preceding
chapter, form a singular feature in the physical aspect of
the island of Sardinia. There are few travellers, I think,
of much experience who, in traversing such tracts of country,
have not been struck at one time by the desolation of
their depths of solitude, or been pleased, at another, by the
glimpses of nomade life, their occasional accompaniments;
and who would not be willing to admit that, in their
general impressions on the imagination, they sometimes
rival even mountain scenery. For if grandeur be one
main ingredient in the sublime, when an object such as a
seemingly boundless level, or rolling plain, the extent of
which the eye is unable to scan, lies before you, when,
after long marches, it still appears interminable, the mind
is perhaps more impressed with the idea of magnitude than
by large masses, however enormous, with defined outlines
presented to the view. In the former instance, the
imagination is called into play and fills out the picture on
a scale corresponding with the actual features, as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
they are subject to observation; but the imagination proverbially
adopts an extravagant measure.</p>

<p>One of my friend's sketches of Campidano scenery, introduced
here, cleverly represents the effects produced by
great distances on one of these rolling plains.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/321.jpg" width="500" height="181" alt="THE CAMPIDANO."
title="THE CAMPIDANO." />
<p class="caption">THE CAMPIDANO.</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the idea of illimitable extent is better conveyed
by the lithographic sketch, No. 8, in which the
level, not being interrupted by the intersection of a mountain
ridge, as in the former, vanishes in distance. But
the termination of the plain in the woodcut is only apparent
as, winding round the base of the mountains, the level
is still continued though lost to sight. It is not however
intended to intimate that these Sardinian plains can at all
vie with the great continental levels in various quarters
of the globe, the immensity of which occurred to my mind,
and some of them to my recollection, when remarking on
the impressions such scenes produce on the traveller's sensations.
The most extensive of the Sardinian Campidani
is only fifty miles in length, and they are all of far less
breadth. Their effect is therefore only comparative, but
being proportioned to the scale of other surrounding objects,
to the area of the insular surface, and the limited height
and extent of the mountain ranges, they produce a proportionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
effect; but that, as it has been already remarked,
is sufficiently striking.</p>

<p>Some brief details of these interesting features in
Sardinian scenery&mdash;the larger of which are termed <i>Campidani</i>,
and the secondary <i>Campi</i>&mdash;will be fitly combined
with a general sketch of the geological formations of the
island; as we are now approaching the same standing
point, the central districts, from which we took occasion
to review the orology of Corsica. It was then remarked
that the mountain systems of the two islands are of similar
character and were formerly united; of which there is
evidence in the rocky islets scattered from one coast to the
other, across the Straits of Bonifacio.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Sardinia, however,
though apparently a continuation of Corsica, is essentially
different in its physical aspect; the elevations being less,
the plains more extensive and fertile, its mineralogical
riches far more varied, and volcanic action on a large scale
being traced throughout the island, while few vestiges of
it are discovered in Corsica.</p>

<p>While these sheets have been passing through the press,
General Alberto de la Marmora has published two volumes
in continuation of his &ldquo;<i>Voyages en Sardaigne</i>,&rdquo; devoted
exclusively, with an accompanying Atlas, to the geology of
the island; a work of the greatest scientific value, from the
high character of the author, and the time he has zealously
spent in his researches, but too elaborate for any attempt
to reduce its details within the compass or the scope of these
pages. Our brief sketch must be confined to a few general
remarks derived from La Marmora's former volumes, and
Captain Smyth's very accurate account of Sardinia;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
availing ourselves also of Mr. Warre Tyndale's digest of
these accounts, and giving some results of our own limited
observation.</p>

<p>The principal chain of primitive mountains trends from
north to south, extending through the districts of Gallura,
Barbagia, Ogliastra, and Budui, along the whole eastern
coast of the island. This range consists of granite, with
ramifications of schist, and large masses of quartz, mica,
and felspar. It is intersected by transverse ranges, and
by plains and valleys partly formed by volcanic agency;
indeed, the connection between the Gallura group and
that of Barbagia is entirely cut off by the great plain of
Ozieri.</p>

<p>The most northerly of the series is the Limbara group.
Its highest peak, according to La Marmora 4287 feet, is
an entire mass of granite. The Genargentu in the Barbagia
range, of the same formation, the highest and most central
mountain in Sardinia, has two culminating points of the respective
heights of 6230 and 6118 feet. They are covered
with snow from September till May, and the inhabitants
of Aritzu, who make it an object of traffic, are, I believe,
able to continue the supply throughout the year.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Monte Oliena in the central group near Nuoro, 4390 feet
high, is calcareous, as are two others, between 2000 and
3000 feet high, in the same chain. It terminates with
the Sette Fratelli, prolonged to Cape Carbonaro, the
eastern point of the gulf of Cagliari, the highest point of
the group, which is entirely granite, being 3142 feet.</p>

<p>We find a detached formation called the Nurra mountains,
composed of granite, schist, and primitive limestone,
filling the isthmus of the Cape at the north-west extremity
of the island, and extending to the little isle of Asinara.
The mountains of Sulcis, at the extreme south-west, and
terminating in the Capes Teulada and Spartivento, are
similarly composed; their highest peaks, the Monte Linas
and Severa, being from 3000 to 4000 feet high.</p>

<p>But the most striking geological feature in Sardinia
consists in the great extent of the volcanic formations.
These, as well as the slighter traces of such action in
Corsica, are doubtless connected with the subterranean
and submarine fires of which the coasts and islands of the
central Mediterranean basin afford so many evidences in
active and extinct volcanoes (some of them in activity in
the times of Homer, Pindar, and Thucydides), and ranging
in a circle from the Roman territory to that of Naples, to
the Lipari islands, Sicily, and those forming the subject of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
our present inquiry. Sardinia has been widely ravaged
by internal fires, but at too remote an era to admit of our
conjecturing the period. The volcanic action can be traced
from Castel Sardo, where it has formed precipices on the
northern coast, to the vicinity of Monastir, a distance
southward of more than 100 miles; its central focus
appearing to have been about half-way between Ales,
Milis, and St. Lussurgiu, where, as Captain Smyth remarks,
&ldquo;the phl&aelig;grean evidences are particularly abundant.&rdquo;
The action was principally confined to the western
side of the island, though, south of Genargentu, the
volcanic formations approach the primitive chain, and the
rounded hills we remarked in the present rambles, after
crossing the Limbara, as far east as Oschiri on the Campo
d'Ozieri, are, I doubt not, craters of extinct volcanoes.
The flat-topped hill, or truncated cone, figured in the
lithograph drawing, No. 8, represents one of them, and,
scattered as these verdant cones are over the long sweeps
of the Campidani, they formed additional features in the
interest with which, as I have already said, we regarded
those immense tracts.</p>

<p>From the supposed centre of volcanic action just suggested,
it may be traced northward through the districts
of Macomer, Bonorva, Giavesu, Keremule, with the hillock
on which Ardara stands, and Codrongianus, to its termination
in the cliffs of Lungo Sardo. But its most salient
feature is the detached group of mountains on the western
coast between Macomer and Orestano, which are entirely
volcanic. This group has the name of &ldquo;Monte del Marghine,&rdquo;
in the small map prefixed to Captain Smyth's
survey, but I do not find that or any other distinct name
attached to it in La Marmora's large &ldquo;Carta dell'Isola.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>&rdquo;
The village of St. Lussurgiu is literally built in a crater
connected with this group, as is also that of Cuglieri. The
highest point, Monte Articu, the summit of Monte Ferro,
entirely volcanic, rises 3442 feet above the Mediterranean,
and the Trebia Lada, 2723 feet high, is one of the three
basaltic feet forming the <i>Trebina</i>, or Tripod, on the summit
of Monte Arcuentu, a mountain between Orestano and
Ales formed of horizontal layers of basalt. Further south
at Nurri, closely approaching the primitive chain, are two
hills, called &ldquo;pizz&egrave;-ogheddu,&rdquo; and &ldquo;pizz&egrave; ogu mannu,&rdquo;
or peaks of the little and great eye, which were certainly
ignivomous mouths, and the peasants believe that they
still have a subterraneous communication. A volcanic
stream has run from them over a calcareous tract, forming
an elevated plain nearly 1600 feet above the level of the
sea, called, &ldquo;<i>Sa giara e Serri</i>.&rdquo; It overlooks Gergei, and
is covered with oaks and cork trees, while the northern
side of its declivity affords rich pasture. North-west from
this place is the &ldquo;<i>Giara di Gestori</i>,&rdquo; of similar formation,
proceeding from a crater at Ales, but strewed with numerous
square masses of stone&mdash;principally fragments of
obsidian, and trachytic and cellular lava&mdash;so as to resemble
a city in ruins. At Monastir there is a distinct double
crater, now well wooded; and a bridge constructed of fine
red trap, with the bold outline of the neighbourhood,
render the entrance to the village by the Strada Reale
singularly picturesque. The volcanic current, flowing
westward from Monastir by Siliqua and Massargiu, again
approached the coast towards the southern extremity of
Sardinia, extending across the deep gulf of Palmas to the
islands of S. Pietro and S. Antonio, which are entirely
composed of trachytic rocks. Their bold escarpments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
arrested our attention on approaching the coast, near Cape
Teulada, in one of our excursions to Sardinia.</p>

<p>Plains of lava, called &ldquo;<i>giare</i>&rdquo; by the natives, are often
found reposing on the large tracts of recent formation,
such as those of Sardara, Ploaghe, and other places; and
considerable extents of trap and pitchstone are frequently
met with on limestone strata, while others, tending fast to
decomposition, are incorporated with an earth formed of
comminuted lava. Vestiges of craters, though generally ill
defined, still exist in the vicinity of Osilo, Florinas, Keremule,
St. Lussurgiu, Monastir, &amp;c. Some of these are
considered, from their less broken and conical shape, and
from the surrounding country consisting of fine red ashes,
slaggy lava, scoria, obsidian, and indurated pozzolana,
with hills of porphyritic trap,&mdash;all lying over tertiary
rock,&mdash;to have been of a much more recent formation
than the others, which in form present a lengthened straggling
appearance, and in composition resemble those of
Auvergne.</p>

<p>The tertiary formation lies on the west side of the principal
granitic chain, and, besides forming the Campidano
and the bases on which the volcanic substances rest, constitutes
the hills of Cagliari, Sassari, and Sorso. The
tertiary limestone seldom ranges more than 1313 feet
above the level of the sea, though at Isili and some
other places it is 1542 feet high. La Marmora considers
it analogous to the upper tertiary formations found in
the south of France, central and southern Italy, Sicily,
Malta, the Balearic Islands, and Africa. The plains generally
consist of a deep alluvial silt, interspersed with
shingly patches, containing boulder stones. Such is the
valley of the Liscia, occupying nearly the whole surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
from sea to sea towards the northern extremity of the
island. This, it may be recollected, we crossed north of
the Limbara. Then succeeds the series of <i>Campi</i> or <i>Campidani</i>,
properly so called. We have already spoken of
the vast plain of Ozieri, terminating in the south-west
with its minor branches, the Campi di Mela, St. Lazarus,
and Giavesu, to which it spreads transversely from the
Gulf of Terranova, on the eastern coast. The bottom of
this gulf forms one of the finest harbours in the island,
with some trade, but the town of that name is a wretched
place, remarkable for its insalubrity and the truculent
character of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>On the western side of the island are the small <i>Campi</i>
of Anglona, lying round Castel Sardo, and another plain
highly cultivated between Sassari and Porto Torres. The
largest of these plains on the eastern side of the island is
that of Orosei, washed by several rivers having their
sources in the neighbouring primitive chain of mountains.
Westward of this chain we have the great central plain,
which, first surrounding the Gulf of Oristano, extends in
an unbroken line, for upwards of fifty miles, to the Gulf
of Cagliari. This is generally spoken of as &ldquo;<i>the Campidano</i>,&rdquo;
without further specification, though its parts are
distinguished by local names, such as&mdash;di Uras, di Gavino,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The mineral riches of Sardinia were well known to the
ancients, and vast excavations, with the remains of a
number of foundries, afford ample testimony of the extent
of their operations. Tradition asserts that gold was formerly
extracted; and there is no doubt that silver was
found in considerable quantities, as it is even now procured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
in assaying the lead. Copper is found near Cape
Teulada, and at other places, and in one of the mines
beautiful specimens of malachite occur. Iron is very
plentifully distributed, but is found principally at the
Monte Santo of Cape Teulada, and at Monte Ferru. The
richest mine is in the Ogliastra, where the <i>intemp&eacute;rie</i>,
however, is so malignant as to preclude the formation of
an establishment. Lead is the most abundant of Sardinian
ores, and its mines are profusely scattered throughout the
islands.</p>

<p>Anthracite has been found, but only that of the Nurra
district is fit for working; and the coal, though met with
in various places in the secondary formations, and especially
in the lower parts of the beds of magnesian limestone,
is neither sufficient in quantity nor good enough in
quality to be generally used. The granites of the Gallura,
as we have already mentioned, were known to the ancients,
and highly appreciated in Italy for their beauty and
colours. Among the other mineral products may also be
mentioned the porphyries of the Limbara, the basalt of
Nurri, Gestori, and Serri, the alabaster of Sarcidanu, and
the marbles of the Goceano and Monte Raso. Jasper
abounds in the trachyte and dolomite, and large blocks, of
beautiful variety, are found in some districts. Among the
chalcedonies are the sardonyx, agates, and cornelian. The
districts from whence the ancients obtained the sardonyx,
once held in high repute, are not known, but the vicinity
of Bosa abounds in chalcedenous formations. A fine
quality of quartz amethyst has been obtained, and also
hydrophane, known for its peculiar property of becoming
transparent when immersed in water. Good turquoises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
and garnets are also found, but not frequently. Though
there have been so many volcanoes, and selenite, gypsum,
lime, and aluminous schist frequently occur, neither
sulphur nor rock salt have been discovered, and but very
little alum. Mineral springs are numerous, but not much
frequented.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

of Phenician Superstitions in Sarde Usages.&mdash;The
Rites of Adonis.&mdash;Passing through the Fire to
Moloch</i>.</p>


<p>We entered Ozieri by a new carriage-road in the course of
construction to connect it with the great Strada Reale
between Sassari and Cagliari; such an undertaking being
a novelty in Sardinia, and, of itself, indicating that Ozieri
is an improving place. It is the chief town of a province,
and contains a population of 8000, having the character of
being, and who were to all appearance, thriving, industrious,
and orderly. The streets are airy and clean,
the principal thoroughfare being watered by a stream
issuing from a handsome fountain. There are many good
houses, and, including the cathedral, a large heavy building,
nine churches in the city, with three massive convents.
That of the Capucins, from its cypress-planted terrace,
commands a fine view of the Campidano, as does the
church of N.S. di Montserrato on the summit of a neighbouring
hill.</p>

<p>The piazza, a large area in the centre of the town, was
thronged with people, lounging and enjoying the evening
air, when we rode into it, not having the slightest idea
where we were to dismount. In this dilemma, observing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
among the crowd, through which we slowly moved, a
serjeant of the Bersaglieri, distinguished by the neat
uniform of his rifle corps, with the drooping plume of
cock's feathers in his cap, we addressed ourselves to him,
having among our letters one to the Commandant of the
garrison, which he undertook to deliver. Meanwhile, he
turned our horses' heads to a house in the piazza, kept by
an Italian, with the accommodations of which we found
reason to be well satisfied.</p>

<p>Mr. Tyndale describes the osteria at Ozieri as execrable,
while, on the other hand, Captain Smyth speaks favourably
of the locanda at Tempio. At the period of our visit the circumstances
were just the reverse. The &ldquo;<i>Caf&eacute; et Restaurant
de Rome</i>&rdquo; proved more than its titles implied. Fully
maintaining the latter of these, it supplied us also with two
good apartments. Mine was festooned with bunches of
grapes hung from the ceiling, and heaps of apples and
pears were stored on shelves&mdash;so there was no lack of
fruit; while, much to our surprise, several excellent <i>plats</i>
were served for supper, the master of the house uniting
the offices of <i>chef de cuisine</i> and <i>gar&ccedil;on</i>. On our praising
his dishes,&mdash;&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, rather theatrically, &ldquo;<i>Je n'ai
pas toujours rempli un tel m&eacute;tier!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Sirs,
I am a Roman exile; I have fought for liberty; I was a
Colonel in the service of the republic,&mdash;and now I make
dishes in Sardinia! But a good time is coming; before
long, I shall be recalled, and then&rdquo;&mdash;there would be an
end of popes and cardinals, &amp;c. He told us that many of
Mazzini's partisans had taken refuge in Sardinia. We
afterwards met with another of them under similar circumstances.
Unwilling to wound the feelings of a Colonel
who, like the Theban general, was also our Amphitryon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
we did not inquire under what circumstances our host had
acquired the arts which he practised so well; suspecting,
however, that our Colonel's earliest experience was in
handling <i>batteries de cuisine</i>. In his double capacity,
he might have more than rivalled in the Crimea even
our &ldquo;General Soyer.&rdquo; To recommend some liqueurs of
his own composition, which certainly were excellent, he
told us that Sir Harry Darrell, who was here the preceding
winter, just before he was seized with the <i>intemp&eacute;rie</i>,
prized them so much that he carried off great part of his
stock.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening we had a visit from the
Commandant. Among other civilities, he made the
agreeable proposal that we should join a party formed by
the Conte di T&mdash;&#8212; to hunt in the mountains south of
Ozieri, following the sport for several days. This scheme
suited us exactly, as it would lead us into the forest district
of Barbagia, which it was our design to visit. Such
is the warmth of the climate, that though it was now the
middle of November, after the Commandant took his leave
we sat to a late hour in our shirt-sleeves, with the casements
wide open on the now solitary piazza, while I wrote and
my companion was drawing. So employed, a strain of distant
music stole on the ear in the stillness of the night,
one of those plaintive melodies common among the Sardes,
a sort of recitative by a tenor voice, with others joining
in a chorus.</p>

<p>Among the many usages derived by the Sardes from
their Phenician ancestors, one of a singular character is
still practised by the Oziese, of which Father Bresciani
gives the following account:&mdash;&ldquo;Towards the end of
March, or the beginning of April, it is the custom for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
young men and women to agree together to fill the relation
of godfathers and godmothers of St. John, <i>compare e
comare</i>&mdash;such is the phrase&mdash;for the ensuing year. At
the end of May, the proposed <i>comare</i>, having procured a
segment of the bark of a cork tree, fashions it in the
shape of a vase, and fills it with rich light mould in
which are planted some grains of barley or wheat. The
vase being placed in the sunshine, well watered and carefully
tended, the seed soon germinates, blades spring up,
and, making a rapid growth, in the course of twenty-one
days,&mdash;that is, before the eve of St. John,&mdash;the vase is
filled by a spreading and vigorous plant of young corn.
It then receives the name of <i>Hermes</i>, or, more commonly,
of <i>Su Nennere</i>, from a Sarde word, which possibly has the
same signification as the Phenician name of garden;
similar vases being called, in ancient times, &#8216;the gardens
of Adonis.&#8217;&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the eve of St. John, the cereal vase, ornamented
with ribbons, is exposed on a balcony, decorated with
garlands and flags. Formerly, also, a little image in
female attire, or phallic emblems moulded in clay, such as
were exhibited in the feasts of Hermes, were placed among
the blades of corn; but these representations have been
so severely denounced by the Church, that they are fallen
into disuse. The young men flock in crowds to witness
the spectacle and attend the maidens who come out to
grace the feast. A great fire is lit on the <i>piazza</i>, round
which they leap and gambol, the couple who have agreed
to be St. John's <i>compare</i> completing the ceremony in this
manner:&mdash;the man is placed on one side of the fire, the
woman on the other, each holding opposite ends of a
stick extended over the burning embers, which they pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
rapidly backwards and forward. This is repeated three
times, so that the hand of each party passes thrice through
the flames. The union being thus sealed, the <i>comparatico</i>,
or spiritual alliance, is considered perfect.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> After that,
the music strikes up, and the festival is concluded by
dances, prolonged to a late hour of the night.</p>

<p>In some places the couple go in procession, attended by
a gay company of youths and damsels, all in holiday
dresses, to some country church. Arrived there, they
dash the vase of Hermes against the door, so that it falls
in pieces. The company then seat themselves in a circle
on the grass, and feast on eggs fried with herbs, while
gay tunes are played on the <i>lionedda</i>.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> A cup of wine is
passed round from one to another, and each, laying his
hand on his neighbour, repeats, with a certain modulation
of voice, supported by the music of the pipes, &ldquo;<i>Compare
e comare di San Giovanni!</i>&rdquo;. The toast is repeated, in a
joyous chorus, for some time, till, at length, the company
rise, still singing, and, forming a circle, dance merrily for
many hours.</p>

<p>Father Bresciani, La Marmora, and other writers, justly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
consider the <i>Nennere</i> as one of the many relics of the
Phenician colonisation of Sardinia. Every one knows
that the Sun and Moon, under various names, such as
Isis and Osiris, Adonis and Astarte, were the principal
objects of worship in the East from the earliest times; the
sun being considered as the vivifying power of universal
nature, the moon, represented as a female, deriving her
light from the sun, as the passive principle of production.
The abstruse doctrines on the origin of things, thus shadowed
out by the ancient seers, generated the grossest
ideas, expressed in the phallic emblems, the lewdness and
obscenities mixed up in the popular worship of the deified
principles of all existence. Of the prevalence in Sardinia
of the Egypto-Phenician mythology, in times the most
remote, no one who has examined the large collection of
relics in the Royal Museum at Cagliari, or who consults
the plates attached to La Marmora's work, can entertain
any doubt. But it is surprising to find, among the usages
of the Sardes at the present day, a very exact representation
of the rites of a primitive religion, introduced into
the island nearly thirty-five centuries ago, though it now
partakes rather of the character of a popular festival than
of a religious ceremony.</p>

<p>The Phenicians worshipped the sun under the name of
Adonis, while the moon, Astarte, the Astaroth of the
Bible, and the Venus-Ouranie of the Greeks, was their
goddess of heaven. The story of Adonis is well known:&mdash;how,
being slain by a wild boar in the Libanus,
his mistress sought him in vain, with loud lamentations,
throughout the earth, and following him to the
infernal regions, prevailed on Proserpine by her tears and
prayers to allow him to spend one half the year on earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
to which he returned in youth perpetually renewed. Thus
was shadowed out the annual course of the sun in the
zodiac, and especially his return to ascendancy at the
summer solstice, a season devoted to joy and festivity.
In after times, this period corresponding with the feast
of St. John the Baptist (24th June), that festival was
celebrated in many parts of Christendom with bonfires
and merriment,&mdash;usages adopted from pagan traditions.
The practices of the <i>Nennere</i>, in the neighbourhood of
Ozieri and other parts of Sardinia, still more distinctly
coincide with the rites which accompanied the ancient
festival.</p>

<p>It was the custom of the Phenician women, towards the
end of May, to place before the shrine, or in the portico
of the temples, of Adonis, certain vessels, in which were
sown grains of barley or wheat. These vessels were made
of wicker-work or pieces of bark, and sometimes wrought
of plaster. The seeds, sown in rich earth, soon sprung
up, and formed plants of luxuriant growth. These verdant
vases were then called by the Phenicians &ldquo;the Gardens of
Adonis.&rdquo; The ceremonies of the summer solstice commenced
over night with lamentations by the women,
expressive of grief for the loss of Adonis. But on the
morrow, &ldquo;when the sun came out of his chamber like a
giant refreshed,&rdquo; all was changed to joy; the garden vases
were crowned with wreaths of purple and various-coloured
ribbons, and the resurrection of the boy-god was celebrated
by dancing, feasting, and revelry. The priestesses
of Adonis led the way in a mysterious procession, bearing
the vases, with other symbols already alluded to, and on
re-entering the temples, dancing and singing, they cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
the vases and scattered their verdure at the feet of the
god. All the women then danced in a circle round the
altar, and the day and night were spent in pious orgies,
feasting, and revelry. It is needless to point out the close
identity of the Oziese <i>Nennere</i> with these Phenician rites.</p>

<p>The worship of Adonis, under the name of Tammuz<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>,
with all its seductive abominations, was one of the
Canaanitish idolatries into which the Israelites were
prone to fall. Father Bresciani considers these rites to be
emphatically referred to in the indignant apostrophe of
Isaiah:&mdash;<i>How is the faithful city become an harlot!...
ye shall be confounded with idols to which ye have sacrificed,
and be ashamed of the gardens which ye have chosen.</i><a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
And again, in the prophet's terrible denunciation:&mdash;<i>Behold,
the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a
whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke
with flames of fire ... and the slain of the Lord
shall be many. They that sanctified themselves and
esteemed themselves clean in the garden of the portico<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.</i></p>

<p>Whether the learned Jesuit's interpretation of these
passages be well founded or not, we may add another
from the prophet Ezekiel, not referred to by him, but of
the application of which to some of these rites there can
be no doubt. In one of those lofty visions, vividly portraying
the iniquities of Israel, her idolatries and wicked
abominations, the prophet's attention is directed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
intolerable scandal that, even <i>at the gate of the Lord's
house, behold there sat women weeping for Tammuz</i>.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>One of the remarkable incidents in the Sarde <i>Nennere</i>,
just described, consists in the consecration of the spiritual
relation between the <i>compare</i> and <i>comare</i>, by their thrice
crossing hands over the fire in the ceremonies of St. John's
day. A still more extraordinary vestige of the idolatrous
rite of &ldquo;passing through the fire,&rdquo; is said to be still subsisting
among the customs of the people of Logudoro, in
the neighbourhood of Ozieri, and in other parts of Sardinia.</p>

<p>Of the worship of Moloch&mdash;<i>par excellence</i> the Syrian
and Phenician god of fire&mdash;by the ancient Sardes, there
is undoubted proof. We find among the prodigious quantity
of such relics, collected from all parts of the island,
in the Royal Museum at Cagliari, a <i>statuette</i> of this idol,
supposed to have been a household god. Its features are
appalling: great goggle eyes leer fiercely from their hollow
sockets; the broad nostrils seem ready to sniff the fumes
of the horrid sacrifice; a wide gaping mouth grins with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
rabid fury at the supposed victim; dark plumes spring
from the forehead, like horns, and expanded wings from
each shoulder and knee. The image brandishes a sword
with the left hand, holding in the right a small grate,
formed of metal bars. It would appear that, this being
heated, the wretched victim was placed on it, and then,
scorched so that the fumes of the disgusting incense
savoured in the nostrils of the rabid idol, it fell upon a
brazier of burning coals beneath, where it was consumed.
There is another idol in this collection with the same
truculent cast of features, but horned, and clasping a
bunch of snakes in the right hand, a trident in the left,
with serpents twined round its legs. This image has a
large orifice in the belly, and flames are issuing between
the ribs, so that it would appear that when the brazen
image of the idol was thoroughly heated, the unhappy
children intended for sacrifice were thrust into the mouth
in the navel, and there grilled,&mdash;savoury morsels, on
which the idol seems, from his features, rabidly gloating,
while the priests, we are told, endeavoured to drown the
cries of the sufferers by shouts and the noise of drums
and timbrels&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo; ... horrid king, besmeared with blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of human sacrifice, and parents' tears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their children's cries unheard, that pass'd through fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his grim idol.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Par. Lost</i>, i. 392.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This cruel child-sacrifice was probably the giving of his
seed to Moloch<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, fwhich any Israelite, or stranger that
sojourned in Israel, guilty of the crime was, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the Mosaic law, to be stoned to death. We are informed
in the Sacred Records, that no such denunciations of the
idolatries of the surrounding nations, no revelations of the
attributes, or teachings of the pure worship of Jehovah,
restrained the Israelites from the practice of the foul and
cruel rites of their heathen neighbours; and we find, in
the latter days of the Jewish commonwealth, the prophet
Jeremiah predicting<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> the desolation of the people for this
sin among others, that they had estranged themselves from
the worship of Jehovah, and burned incense to strange
gods, and filled the holy place with the blood of innocents,
and burned their sons and their daughters with fire for
burnt-offerings unto Baal.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>There appear to have been two modes in which the
ancient idolaters devoted their children to Moloch. In
one they were sacrificed and consumed in the manner
already described, a burnt-offering to the cruel idol for the
expiation of the sins of their parents or their people. In
the other, they were only made <i>to pass through the fire</i>, in
honour of the deity, and as a sort of initiation into his
mysteries, and consecration to his service. Thus Ahaz,
King of Judah, is said to have &ldquo;made his son to pass
through the fire, according to the abominations of the
heathen.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> And it is reckoned in the catalogue of the
sins of Judah, which drew on them the vengeance of God,
that they &ldquo;built the high places of Baal, to cause their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto
Moloch.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>In the case of infants, it is supposed that this initiation,
this &ldquo;baptism by fire,&rdquo; was performed either by placing
them on a sort of grate suspended by chains from the vault
of the temple, and passed rapidly over the sacred fire, or
by the priests taking the infants in their arms, and swaying
them to and fro over or across the fire, chanting meanwhile
certain prayers or incantations. With respect to
children of older growth, they were made to leap naked
through the fire before the idol, so that their whole bodies
might be touched by the sacred flames, and purified, as it
were, by contact with the divinity.</p>

<p>The Sardes, we are informed by Father Bresciani<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> still
preserve a custom representing this initiation by fire, but,
as in other Phenician rites and practices, without the
slightest idea of their profane origin. In the first days
of spring, from one end of the island to the other, the
villagers assemble, and light great fires in the <i>piazze</i> and
at the cross-roads. The flames beginning to ascend, the
children leap through them at a bound, so rapidly and
with such dexterity, that when the flames are highest it is
seldom that their clothes or a hair of their head are singed.
They continue this practice till the fuel is reduced to
embers, the musicians meanwhile playing on the <i>lionedda</i>
tunes adapted to a Phyrric dance. This, says the learned
Father, is a representation of the initiation through fire
into the mysteries of Moloch; and, singular as its preservation
may appear through the vast lapse of time since such
rites were practised, we see no reason to doubt his relation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
exactly as he treats on this subject after repeated visits to
the island, even if the account were not confirmed by
other writers, as we find it is. Bresciani's recent work
is almost entirely devoted, as we have already observed, to
the task of tracing numerous customs still existing among
the Sardes to their eastern origin. We may find future
opportunities of noticing some in which the coincidence is
most striking.</p>

the Oak Timber.&mdash;Cork Trees; their Produce, and Statistics

Feast.&mdash;A Bivouac in the Woods.&mdash;Notices of the Province
of Barbagia.&mdash;Independence of the Mountaineers.</i></p>


<p>The hunting excursion in the mountains south of Ozieri
was in the order of the day, the expedition being on a
much larger scale than that arranged by our honest Tempiese
friends at the <i>Caff&egrave; de la Costituzione</i>. We were
to camp out; and the party consisted of upwards of thirty
horsemen, well mounted and armed, with the Conte di
T&mdash;&#8212; and some other Oziese gentlemen for leaders. We
had also a large pack of dogs, some of them fine animals,
almost equal to bloodhounds.</p>

<p>Our route from the town led us over a succession of
scraggy hills, with cultivation in the bottoms, and some
straggling vineyards, not very flourishing. The walnut
trees in the glens, and small inclosures mixed with copse
wood, reminded us more of English or Welsh scenery than
anything we had before seen in either of the Mediterranean
islands. After passing a village standing on high ground,
there was a long ascent, and in about an hour and a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
from our leaving Ozieri, on gaining the summit of a ridge
of hills outlying from the Goceano range, we opened on a
magnificent view of the great central chain of mountains,
stretching away to the south-east in giant limbs and folds,
with Genargentu and other summits shrouded in a grey
silvery haze. A broad valley was spread out beneath our
point of view, and the mountain range immediately opposite,
the lower regions of which, as far as the eye could
command the view, right and left, were clothed with dense
forests, straggling down in broken masses and detached
clumps to the edge of the intervening valley.</p>

<p>Into the depths of these forests we were to penetrate in
pursuit of our game, and finer covers to be stocked with
<i>cingale</i> and <i>capriole</i>, or bolder scenery for the theatre of
our sylvan sport, can scarcely be imagined. It was spirit-stirring
when, full in view of these grand natural features,
our numerous cavalcade wound down the hill in scattered
groups to the plain beneath, among pollard cork trees, just
now shedding their acorns. There was deep ploughing
in the rich vale watered by the upper streams of the Tirso,
which winds through the valley at the foot of the Goceano
range. After crossing the holms, we were on slopes of
greensward, lightly feathered with the red fern, and dotted
with trees, like a park.</p>

<p>And now we touched the verge of the forest, rough
with brakes of giant heaths, such underwood alternating
with grassy glades wherever the woods opened. This part
of the forest consists of an unbroken mass of primitive
cork trees of great size. The rugged bark, the strangely-angular
growth of the limbs, hung with grey lichens in
fantastic combs, and the thick olive-green foliage almost
excluding the light of heaven, with the roar of the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
through the trees,&mdash;for it was a dull, cold day, the coldest
we spent in Sardinia,&mdash;with all this, a Scandinavian forest
could not be more dreary and savage. After tracking the
gloomy depths of shade for a considerable distance, it was
an agreeable change to quit the forest and warm our blood
by cantering up a slope of scrub. Then, after crossing a
grassy hollow, we came among scattered woods of the most
magnificent oaks, both evergreen and deciduous, I ever saw.
Some of the trees were of enormous size, and if the quality
of the timber be equal to the scantling, Sardinia would
supply materials of great value for naval purposes.</p>

<p>The forests of the Barbagia, into which we now penetrated,
like those of the Gallura, are principally virgin
forests; the want of roads, of navigable rivers, and even of
flottage, presenting formidable obstacles to the conveyance
of the timber to the seaboard for exportation, though the
first is not insurmountable. The forests of the Marghine
and Goceano ranges round Macomer, having the little
port of Boso on the western coast for an outlet, are felled
to some extent. The contracts are mostly in the hands of
foreigners, who obtain them on such low terms that their
profits are enormous. Mr. Tyndale gives the details of a
contract obtained by a Frenchman for 18,000 oak trees,
at fifteen <i>lire nove</i>, 12<i>s.</i> each, the trees being said to realise
from 200 to 300 francs (8<i>l.</i> to 12<i>l.</i>) each at Toulon or Marseilles.
In England, we pay from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per
cubic foot for very indifferent American oak, and from
1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for Baltic oak, perhaps superior to the
Sardinian.</p>

<p>In the course of the Corsican notices in this volume, it
was mentioned that after my return to England, I had
some communications with a government department respecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
the pine forests of Corsica.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> On my taking occasion
also to represent the great abundance of oak timber
of large dimensions standing in Sardinia, I learnt that a
valuable report on the subject had been made to the
Admiralty by Mr. Craig, Her Majesty's excellent Consul-General
in the island. It did not, however, appear that
any steps had been taken in consequence.</p>

<p>Great damage is done to the forests by the herdsmen
and shepherds, who are permitted, under certain restrictions,
to burn down portions of underwood, such as the
lentiscus, daphne, and cistus, to allow the pasturage to
grow for their flocks. But though this is not legal before
the eighth of September, when the intense heat of the
summer has passed away, and the periodical autumnal
rains are necessary for the young herbage, the law is
broken, and not only accidental but wilful conflagrations
have been the destruction of numerous forests. What
with this waste, the injury done to the growing timber by
the contractors, and the indolence of the natives, the noble
forests of Sardinia are of little account. Even the government,
it is said, purchase most of the oak used in the
dockyards of Genoa at the French ports before mentioned.</p>

<p>Similar observations apply to cork, though capable of
easier transport, and said to be as fine as any in the world.
The Sardinian forests would supply large quantities; but
it enters little into the exports of the island. We saw a
great many trees stripped by the peasants for domestic uses,
naked and miserable skeletons; with them it is indiscriminate
slaughter, doing irreparable injury to the trees. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
now lie before me the specimens I collected of the successive
layers of the bark. The spongy external cuticle,
swelling into excrescences, is only used for floats of the
fishermen's nets in the island. Beneath lies a coating of
more compact, but cellular, tissue, of a beautiful rich
colour&mdash;a sort of red umber. This layer, called <i>la camicia</i>
(the shift), covers the good or &ldquo;female&rdquo; bark, with which
every one is acquainted in the shape of corks.</p>

<p>The bark will bear cutting every ten years, commencing
when the trees are about that age; but it should not be
cut till the inner bark is an inch or an inch and a quarter
thick. I consider that the bark of old trees is less valuable.
Some of those we saw in the forests of the Gallura
and Barbagia must have been the growth of many centuries.
It is calculated that each tree, on an average,
produces upwards of 30 lbs. of bark at a cutting; there
are about 220 lbs. in a quintal, worth, at Marseilles, 20
francs; and a quintal of cork makes from 4500 to 5000
bottle-corks.</p>

<p>The woods are generally leased at an annual rent, proportioned
to the number of trees; but this rent, with the
cost of stripping the bark, and even the transport to the
coast, form but small items in the lessee's account of profit
and loss. The heaviest charges are the export duty from
Sardinia, the freight, and the import duties in France, to
which country, I understand, the greatest part of the cork
cut in the island is shipped. The French customs' duty is
2frs. 20 cents. the quintal. England imports no cork in
its rough state from the island of Sardinia; but probably
a considerable part of the manufactured corks we import
from France (upwards of 226,000 lbs. in 1855<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>) grew in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
Sardinian forests. Our principal imports of unmanufactured
cork bark are from Portugal, the quantity in the
year just mentioned being 3300 tons and upwards. From
Spain we only received 300 tons, and about 100 from Tuscany
and other parts; the official value being from 32<i>l.</i> to
35<i>l.</i> per ton. It appears extraordinary that we should
draw so considerable a portion of our supplies of this valuable
commodity from France in a manufactured state, and
subject to a heavy customs' duty and other double charges,
when the raw material might be imported direct from
Sardinia, subject only to an export duty of 1fr. 20 cents.
per quintal. This arises, I imagine, from the trade being
left by the apathy of the islanders mostly in the hands of
French houses, who take leases of the forests and conduct
the whole operations.</p>

<p>These details, though they smack of woodcraft, have led
us away from our sylvan sports. We had reached the
point where the dogs were thrown into the covers with a
party detached to drive the woods. Having given a description
in a former chapter of the <i>caccia clamorosa</i>, as
wild boar hunting is well termed by the Sardes, repetition
would be wearisome. It was conducted precisely as on
the former occasion, except that the proceedings were on a
more extended scale, and led us far among wilder and
more varied scenery. As before, the stations of the
hunters were assigned at about seventy or eighty paces
apart, with the horses tethered in the rear. The line of
shooters was first formed among the heather on the easy
slope of a glen, lightly sprinkled with wood. The exhilarating
sounds of the men and dogs breaking the silence of
the woods as they drove the game before them, the minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
of eager expectation, the sharp look-out, the ringing shots,
may now be easily imagined.</p>

<p>My fellow-traveller was fortunate enough to knock over
the first wild boar that ran the gauntlet of the <i>cordon</i>,
when the Count's gun had missed fire from the cap having
become damp. Our next position was in an open piece of
forest, where luck planted me in a notched cork tree,
standing on a wooded knoll, at which several avenues met,
so that I had not only a good chance of a shot, but the
command of the <i>champ de bataille</i> on all sides. Wild
boars were plentiful, roebucks not so, hares innumerable
in some of our <i>battues</i>. I confess, however, that the incident
in the day's sport in which I felt most interest was
when a wild boar, slightly wounded, rushed by one of my
posts, pursued by some of the dogs. Throwing myself on
my spirited barb, I led the chase, followed by my neighbours,
right and left, and was lucky enough to be in at the
death, after a sharp run. Under such circumstances the
wild boar, standing at bay with his formidable tusks, becomes
dangerous to the dogs, if not to the hunters. Then
the sharp steel is wanting. Oh, for a boar spear! instead
of having to despatch the rabid animal by a shot.</p>

<p>Having had a long morning's ride, our first day's <i>battue</i>
was closed early. The party defiled in loose order among
the trees in the open forest, cantered over springy turf,
and brushed through patches of fern to a sheltered dell in
which we were to bivouac, and where the sumpter horses
had already halted. Then followed such a rude feast as in
all my rambles I had never before chanced to witness.
Imagine the grassy margin of a rivulet, surrounded by
thick bushes, which spread in brakes throughout the glen
under scattered oaks, intermingled with crags and detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
masses of rock, covered with white lichens. On the grass
are piles of flat bread, which served for plates, loads of
sausages, hams, cheeses, bundles of radishes, and heaps of
apples, pears, grapes, and chestnuts, strewed about in the
happiest confusion, with no lack of flasks and runlets of
various sorts of wines. Our contribution to the pic-nic,
a basket of signor Juliani's best cold dishes and larded
fowls, seemed perfectly insignificant. Add to all this, the
game we had bagged,&mdash;wild boar and roebuck, to say nothing
of hares,&mdash;and the general stock might seem inexhaustible,
if one glance at the crowd of hungry hunters
did not banish the thought.</p>

<p>Eager for the attack, they were busily employed in preparations
for it. Horses were unsaddled and tethered
among the bushes, guns piled or rested against the boughs,
wood collected, fires lighted, and dagger-knives whetted,
ready to rip open and quarter the game. The leaders only
stood apart, under a spreading tree. They had a grave
duty to perform in apportioning the spoils among those
who had been successful in the day's sport. This was
done with great exactness and the perfect equality existing
among all ranks on these occasions. It was Robin Hood
and his merry men all through; or might have been taken
for an episode of Sarde banditti life, except that, our party
being all honest fellows, there was no plunder to divide.
By the laws of the chase in Sardinia, the hunter to whose
gun an animal falls is entitled exclusively to some distinct
portion, varying with the species of the game,&mdash;sometimes
to the skin, sometimes to the choicest parts of the <i>roba
interiora</i>, the intestines; the rest falls into the common
stock. The award being made, such choice morsels, with
rashers of hog and venison steaks, were grilled over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
embers on skewers of sweet wood, and handed round, filled
each pause in the attack on the cold provisions, portions
being detached by the formidable <i>couteaux de chasse</i> with
which every man was armed; nor did English steel fail of
doing its duty.</p>

<p>Though the party distributed themselves indiscriminately
on the grass, they naturally fell into familiar
messes, perfect harmony and good fellowship prevailing.
But at times there was great confusion. Now, the horses,
kicking and fighting, got free from their tethers, and
there was a rush of the hunters to restore order; while
the ravenous hounds, not content with the bones and fragments
thrown to them, were making perpetual inroads on
the circle of guests, and snatching at the morsels they
were appropriating to themselves. The feast was drawing
to a close, when Count T&mdash;&#8212; proposed the health of the
foreigners associated in their sports, and the toast, with
the reply, which, if not eloquent, was short and feeling,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Agli
nobili cacciatori della Sardegna, e di noi forestieri
li sozii amicissimi, benevolentissimi</i>,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., drew
forth <i>ev-vivas</i> which made the old woods ring to the echo.
And now all started on their legs, and there was a rush to
the guns as if scouts had suddenly announced that the
woods were filled with enemies. As an hour or two of
daylight still remained, a <i>bersaglio</i>, or match of shooting
at a mark, had been arranged during the feast.</p>

<p>The <i>bersaglio</i> is a favourite amusement of the Sardes,
forming part of most of their festivities; and constant
practice on these occasions, and in the field, makes them
expert shots. Our party now addressed themselves to this
exercise of skill with passionate eagerness. Some ran to
fix a small card against the bole of a tree, eighty or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
hundred yards distant, the rest gathered round the point
of sight, loading their guns or applying caps, all talking
rapidly, in sharp tones, as if they were quarrelling. They
formed picturesque groups, in all attitudes&mdash;those mountain
rangers, with their semi-Moorish costume, embroidered
pouches, and bright ornamented arms, their dark-olive
complexions and bushy hair, in strong contrast with their
visitors from the north, in gray plaid and brown felt, unmistakable
in their physiognomy, though almost as hairy
and sunburnt as the children of the soil. The match was
well contested, the card being often hit; which, as the
Sarde guns are not rifled, may be considered good shooting,
at the distance stated. The firing was continued till it
was almost dark with eager zest, but much irregularity,
and almost as great an expenditure of animal spirits in
vociferation, as of powder and bullets.</p>

<p>An hour after sunset, when night came on, fresh wood
was heaped on the smouldering fires, and after sitting
round them, smoking and chatting, the party gradually
broke up, some stretching themselves near the embers,
and the rest seeking some shelter for the night, about
which a Sarde mountaineer is not fastidious, any bush or
hollow in a rock serving his purpose. For ourselves,
after exchanging the &ldquo;<i>felice notte</i>&rdquo; with the Count and
his friends, we lingered over a scene so singular in civilised
Europe, though with such I had been familiar in other
hemispheres. The smouldering fires cast fitful gleams on
piled arms and the hardy men sleeping around in their
sheepskins or shaggy cloaks; the deep silence of the woods
was only broken by a neighing horse or the bay of a
hound, and presently the stars shone out from the vault of
heaven with a lustre unknown in northern climes. We,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
too, lay down ensconced in a brake, the younger traveller
disdaining any other wrapping than his plaid, and the
elder luxuriously enveloped in a couple of blankets which
formed part of his equipments, having his saddle for a
pillow. With sound sleep, the rivulet for our ablutions,
and a hot cup of coffee, bread, cheese, and fruit for the
<i>collazione</i>,&mdash;what more could be wanting?</p>

<p>In this expedition one day was like another, except in
the ever-varying scenery, interesting enough to the traveller,
but wearisome in description. Suffice it to say,
that on the third morning, the provisions being exhausted,
and no fresh supplies to be had in that wild country, our
leaders decided on returning to Ozieri. It then became a
question with us whether we should return with them, or
pursue the mountain tracks to Nuoro, whence it was only
two days' journey to the foot of Monte Genargentu, on
the higher regions of which it had been our intention to
hunt the <i>moufflon</i>, proceeding then, along byroads, through
a chain of mountain villages to Cagliari. Nuoro, a poor
place, though dignified with the title of &ldquo;<i>citt&agrave;</i>,&rdquo; and a
large ecclesiastical establishment, stands high on a great
table-land in the heart of the central chain, answering, in
many respects, to the Corte of the sister island. This
ancient capital of Barbagia is still the chief place of a
province containing a population of 54,000 souls, very
much scattered through an extensive and mountainous
district, but containing many large villages, such as Fonni,
Tonara, and Aritzu already mentioned.</p>

<p>The mountaineers of Barbagia have been distinguished
from the earliest times for their indomitable courage and
spirit of independence. Some of the best ancient writers
relate that Iolaus, son of Iphicles, king of Thessaly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
nephew of Hercules, settled Greek colonies in this part of
the island. The expedition, in which he was joined by the
Thespiad&aelig;, was undertaken in obedience to the oracle of
Delphi; and it declared that, on their establishing themselves
in Sardinia, they would never be conquered. Iolaus
is said to have been buried in this district, after founding
many cities; and, the Greek colonists intermingling with
the native Sardes, their descendants, deriving their name
of Iolaese or Iliese from their founder, became the most
powerful race in the island,&mdash;just as the Roumains of
Wallachia, boasting their descent from Trajan's Dacian
colonists, long proved their right to the proud patronymic.</p>

<p>The Iolaese offered a determined resistance to the Carthaginian
invaders, and, on the decline of their power in
Sardinia, maintained, during a long series of years, an
unequal contest with the Roman legions; for, though
often worsted in pitched battles, they found a safe and
impregnable retreat in their mountain fastnesses. The
triumphs of the Romans figure in history; but the traditions
of the Sardes do justice to the heroic and patriarchal
chiefs who fought in defence of their country. In after
times, the Barbaricini (the Barbari of the Romans,
whence Barbagia) exhibited their hereditary warlike spirit
in resisting the invasions of the Moors; and, when Sardinia
passed to the crown of Arragon, they refused to
acknowledge Alfonso's rights and authority, resisting all
claims of homage, tribute, or service. A sullen submission
of three centuries to their Spanish sovereigns had not
effaced their spirit of independence, and the Barbaricini
were in arms against an unjust tax, and, moving their
wives, children, and valuables to the mountains, kept the
Spaniards entirely at bay, when, in 1719, Sardinia was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
ceded to the house of Savoy. The demand being prudently
withdrawn, they returned to their villages, and
their allegiance to the present dynasty has not been
broken by any open revolt. But the indomitable spirit of
their race has still been exhibited in sullen or violent
resistance to the Piedmontese authorities. Driven by the
corrupt administration of the laws to take a wild and
summary justice, every man's hand has been against his
neighbours' and the government officials. Mr. Tyndale
states &ldquo;that upwards of 100 (or one in every 279) annually
fall victims to <i>vendetta</i>, in contest with their enemies, or with
the authorities. Those openly known to live in the mountains
as <i>fuorusciti</i>, of some kind, are more than 300; and to
them may be added another 300 unknown to the Government,
so that, on an average, there is nearly one in every
46 an outcast from society, a fugitive from his hearth.&rdquo; I
was happy to learn, on a second visit to the island of Sardinia,
in 1857, that the numbers of these unhappy men
were decreasing, outrages had diminished, and the system
of <i>vendetta</i> was gradually dying out. This, it was stated,
principally resulted from the Barbaricini beginning to feel
that the government is able and willing to afford them the
redress of their private wrongs, and the personal protection
which, as individuals or banded together, they have so long
asserted by the red hand in defiance of the authorities.</p>

<p>Thus the independence predicted by the oracle of Delphi
to the race of Iolaus, preserved for untold centuries and
through all political changes, has been maintained to the
last by their direct descendants, the <i>fuorusciti</i> of Barbagia.
They were in arms as late as our travels in 1853,
and we were officially warned against venturing into the
mountains without due precautions. It was not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
this state of affairs which interfered with the prosecution
of our journey, as we did not doubt being able to establish,
as foreigners, amicable relations with their chiefs. Such a
state of society could not be without interest, the scenery
is represented as most romantic, the shooting excellent;
but our time was limited, and, reserving the expedition to
Barbagia for a future opportunity, we reluctantly retraced
our steps to Ozieri, in company with our friendly hunters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>Ozieri standing on the verge of the great Sardinian plains,
we dismissed our <i>cavallante</i>, and changed our mode of
travelling. A primitive <i>diligence</i> plies occasionally between
Ozieri and Sassari, by the new road just constructed to
join the Strada Reale between Cagliari and Porto Torres.
Missing the opportunity during our hunting excursion, we
hired a <i>voiture</i> for the day's journey. It was comparatively
a smart affair, a light <i>cal&egrave;che</i> with bright yellow
pannels, and drawn by a pair of quick-stepping horses; so
that we travelled in much comfort. Carriages are seldom
found in the island except on this great road, and in a few
of the principal towns; the mode of travelling in the interior,
for persons of all ranks and both sexes, being either
on horseback or on oxen.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>
<p>We rattled out of Ozieri with a flourish of the driver's
horn, more intent on which than on the management of his
spirited horses he nearly brought us to grief. After some
narrow escapes of being capsized over the heaps of stones
scattered along the new road, now in the course of construction,
we came to a dead lock in an excavation; and
one of the horses, though mettlesome enough, hung in the
collar, refusing to draw. It was said to be an Irish horse,
but how or when it got to Sardinia was as much a myth
as the immigration of some of the various races by which
the island is said to have been peopled in ancient times.
However, Miss Edgeworth's Irish postilion and &ldquo;Knockecroghery,&rdquo;
could scarcely have afforded us more amusement
than our Sarde driver and his horse, whose good
qualities he ludicrously vaunted, alternately cursing and
glorifying, thumping and coaxing, the vicious beast, while
we heaved at the wheels. Our united efforts at length
succeeded in extricating the vehicle from the sandy hollow;
and after jolting for awhile over the new-formed road, the
material having become solid and compact, we rolled at
our ease across the plain. I remarked, that though the
road was well levelled and macadamised, scarcely a man
was to be seen employed in the present operations. Boys
were breaking the metal, and girls carrying it in baskets on
their heads.</p>

<p>The plains being undulating, extensive views are commanded
by the eminences far away over the Campidano,
backed by the Limbara mountains on the north-west. We
passed the village of Nores, pleasantly situated on a hill
at the verge of the Ozieri plain, across which Monte
Santo, appearing from this point a long ridge, rose in full
view to our left, 2000 feet high. The junction with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
Strada Reale from Cagliari to Sassari was reached soon
afterwards. About noon, we halted while the horses baited
at a roadside <i>locanda</i>, the half-way house to Sassari, standing
at the foot of Monte Santo, here reduced to the shape
of a round-topped mountain. Lesser hills fell away to the
great plain, the slopes and flats being sprinkled with large
flocks of sheep. On a hillock two or three miles distant,
were the ruins of a Nuraghe, mellowed to a rich orange
tint.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant spot, and at the present moment
full of life, numbers of Sardes of all classes having, like
ourselves, halted there for rest. Two <i>voitures</i> were drawn
up by the roadside, as well as several light carts, with high
wheels and tilts made of rushes or cloth, conveying goods
to and fro between Cagliari and Sassari. Women in yellow
petticoats and red mantles, with bright kerchiefs round
their heads, and men in their white shirt sleeves open to the
elbow, and Moorish cotton trowsers, contrasting with their
dark jackets, caps, and gaiters, were bustling about, fetching
water and fodder for the horses. Others were sitting
and eating under the shade of a group of weeping willows,
overshadowing a bason of pure water, fed by a streamlet
trickling down from the neighbouring hills. Intermingled
with these were Sarde cavaliers, in a more brilliant
costume; and a priest, carrying a huge crimson umbrella,
came forth from the <i>locanda</i>, and with his attendants,
mounting their horses, proceeded on their journey at a pace
suited to the priest's gravity, and the requirements of his
gorgeous canopy.</p>

<p>Presently a horn sounded, and a coach came thundering
down the hill,&mdash;the diligence on its daily service between
the two capitals. The vehicle was double-bodied, well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
horsed, and, altogether, a superior turn-out. We took the
opportunity of its pulling up for a moment to bespeak
beds at Sassari. After amusing ourselves with a scene of
life on the road not often witnessed in Sardinia,&mdash;having
already lunched in our <i>voiture</i> on a basket of grapes, with
bread, and a bottle of the excellent white wine of Oristano,&mdash;we
sauntered up the course of the rivulet to its source,
at the foot of a rock among the woods. There we drank
of the clear fountain, and washed; bees humming among
the flowers, as in the height of the summer, and the
gabble from the roadside below, coming up mixed with
the cries of the carrier's fierce dogs. The spot commanded
charming views of Monte Santo and the far-stretching
<i>campagna</i> beneath.</p>

<p>Pursuing our route, the country assumed a peculiar
aspect from the number of the flat-topped hills, swelling
in green slopes out of the plains which spread before us
in long sweeps. These vividly green hillocks are probably
the craters of long extinct volcanoes, as we were now in
the line, and near the centre, of that wide igneous action
mentioned in a former chapter. There were signs of more
extensive cultivation than we had hitherto observed, and
the evident fertility of the soil left no doubt on the mind
of its powers of production under a better system. Large
flocks of sheep were feeding in every direction; this being
the season for their being driven from the mountains for
pasture and shelter in the teeming plains. Sardinia remains
still in that pastoral state, which, however picturesque
to the eyes of the traveller, as well as suited to
the indolent habits of the Sarde peasant, must yield to
agricultural progress, or, at least, be reduced within due
bounds, before the soil of the island can be made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
source of that wealth which, with proper cultivation, large
portions of it are naturally fitted to yield. Sardinia will
continue to be poor and uncivilised while vast tracts of
country are open to almost promiscuous and lawless commonage,
and while the occupation of the shepherd, with
all its hardships, is esteemed preferable and more honourable
than that of the tiller of the soil.</p>

<p>After this, we got among hills bounding the plain in
the neighbourhood of Florinas and Campo di Mela. The
country became rugged, and, after crossing a river, over a
still perfect Roman bridge, of several arches, with massive
substructions of large square stones, which we alighted to
examine, there commenced a steep ascent, winding among
woods. We walked up it by moonlight, our driver's bugle
echoing that of a <i>diligence</i> which preceded us at some distance
in mounting the pass. Sassari was entered by an
arched and embattled gateway in the square-towered wall
surrounding the place; and, passing through the best
quarter of the town, the dark mass of the citadel contrasting
well with the white <i>fa&ccedil;ades</i> and lofty colonnades of
the neighbouring houses, we were set down at the Albergo
di Progresso, opposite the great convent of St. Pietro, one
of the richest of the many religious houses of which Sassari
once boasted. The accommodations at the hotel were the
best we enjoyed in the island.</p>

<p>Sassari, the second city of Sardinia, containing a population
of some 30,000 souls, has always been a jealous rival
of Cagliari, the metropolis, boasting an independent history
of its own, of which it has just pretensions to be
proud. It was an insignificant village till the inhabitants
of Porto-Torres,&mdash;the ancient <i>Turris Libysonis</i>, founded on
the neighbouring coast by the Greeks, and colonised by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
Romans,&mdash;were driven by the incursions of the Saracen
corsairs, and, finally, by the ruin of their town by the
Genoese, in 1166, to seek a refuge further inland. They
established themselves at Sassari, where the long street,
still called Turritana, was named from the new settlers.
In 1441, the archiepiscopal see and chapter of St. Gavino,
near Porto-Torres, were translated to Sassari by Pope
Eugenius IV., and thenceforward it rivalled the metropolis
in opulence and power. When, in the thirteenth century,
the Genoese occupied the northern division of the island,
Sassari became a republic, entering into an alliance, offensive
and defensive, with that of Genoa. The articles of
the treaty are a curious amalgamation of independence
assumed by the one, and of interference and jurisdiction
claimed by the other. The general effect was, that the
Sassarese accepted annually from the Genoese a Podesta,
who swore fidelity to their constitution; and the Sassarese
assert that while their city was under the protection of
Genoa, they only styled that haughty republic in their
statutes and diplomas, &ldquo;<i>Mater et Magistra, sed non Domina:</i>&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>non Signora, ma Amica.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mutual quarrels induced a rupture of the alliance in
1306, and on the Arragonese kings advancing pretensions
to the sovereignty of the island, the Sassarese made a
voluntary transfer of their allegiance to Diego II. of
Arragon, who, in return, guaranteed their rights and
privileges; and Sassari continued to be governed as a
republic long after the Spanish conquest in 1325. The
city, however, suffered severely during the protracted
contests between the Genoese, Pisans, and the Giudici of
Arborea, for the expulsion of the Spaniards; sustaining no
less than ten sieges, courageously defended, in the short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
interval between 1332 and 1409. It continued to be the
victim of contending parties till 1420, when for the last time,
and after a struggle of nearly a hundred years, it fell into
the hands of Alfonso V., who conferred on it the title of
&ldquo;Citt&agrave; Reale.&rdquo; In the middle of the fifteenth century
it flourished both commercially and politically, enjoying
privileges beyond any other town in the island. From
this power and prosperity arose its rivalry with Cagliari;
and the jealousies and dissensions in matters of government,
religion, and education, surviving the transference of
the sovereignly to the House of Savoy, have descended
from generation to generation.</p>

<p>This feeling prevails to the present day, partly owing,
perhaps, to the circumstance of society in Sassari being
less under the influence of Piedmontese and Continental
opinions than in the capital, Cagliari,&mdash;and partly to the
Sassarese population being mostly of Genoese extraction.
The descendants of these settlers having almost all the
trade, commerce, and employment in their hands, form
a very important and influential middle class. I found
at Sassari opinions more distinctly pronounced on the
abuses of the government, and the necessity of reforms
in the various branches of the administration, than I have
reason to believe they are in the more courtly circles of
Cagliari. Some numbers of a work, in course of publication,
were put into my hands during our stay at Sassari,
in which these topics were discussed in a sensible, bold,
but temperate style.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Though written by a foreigner, a
Venetian refugee, I have no doubt, from the manner in
which it was spoken of by well-informed persons, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
from its having reached a second edition, that it may be
accepted as representing the opinions of a large class of
the Sassarese, and I imagine of Sardes in general.</p>

<p>Much interest attaches to the working of the constitutional
system in the Sardinian dominions, not only politically,
but in its effects on the social and economical condition
of the country. Hitherto the island of Sardinia
has been treated by the cabinet of Turin much as it was
long the misfortune of the English government to deal
with Ireland; regarding the native race as a conquered,
but turbulent, impracticable and semi-barbarous people;
the consequences of such misrule being poverty, disaffection
and bloodshed. But I trust we see the dawn of
brighter days, when this fine island, partaking of the
benefits following in the train of constitutional government,&mdash;its
wrongs redressed, its great natural resources
developed, and the natural genius and many virtues of its
inhabitants being cultivated and having free scope,&mdash;will
be no insignificant jewel in the crown which assumed
its regal title from this insular possession.</p>

<p>With our own happy country in the van of political,
social, and material progress, there are three secondary
European states, which, in our own memory, have raised
the banner of freedom, and are consistently marching
under it with firm, vigorous, and well-poised steps. It
need hardly be explained that we speak of Norway, Belgium,
and Sardinia.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Occupying, geographically and
politically, important positions ranging, at wide intervals,
from the far north to the extreme south of Europe, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
small, flourishing, and well-ordered states, offer a spectacle
as full of hope and encouragement to all lovers of constitutional
liberty, as it must necessarily be offensive to the
despotic governments of the great continental monarchies,
on whose thresholds the altars of freedom, newly lighted,
have burnt with so steady and pure a flame. They may
serve as beacon-lights to European populations gasping for
that political regeneration, the hour of which will assuredly
come, and may not be far distant.</p>

<p>Of the state and prospects of the kingdom of Norway,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
we have treated in another work. The democratic element
is so predominant in its constitutional code, that the
only fear was lest it should clash with the executive
functions of even a limited monarchy. But, hitherto, the
natural good sense, patriotism, and loyalty of the Norwegian
people, though represented in a Storthing of peasant
farmers,&mdash;and we may add, the moderation displayed by
the Bernadotte dynasty,&mdash;have so obviated the difficulties
of a hastily formed, and somewhat crude, code of fundamental
laws, that it has been harmoniously worked to the
great benefit of the nation. In Belgium, notwithstanding
religious antagonisms, which have also perplexed the
young councils of Sardinia, the constitutional system has
been so consolidated, under the rule of a sagacious prince,
that it may be hoped its permanence is secured. We need
not speak of the rising fortunes of the Sardinian States,
the only hope of fair Italy. The eyes of Europe are upon
them; they are closely watched by friends and foes. Our
business at present is, not with the political, but with the
social and material, condition of the insular kingdom which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
forms a valuable portion of those singularly aggregated
dominions. In a work devoted to a survey of the island,
even a passing traveller may be pardoned for pausing in
his narrative while he collects some cursory notices of its
present condition under these aspects, and its requirements
for improvement.</p>

<p>All enlightened Sardes with whom we conversed unite
with Signor Sala, who has devoted several sections of his
work to the subject, in representing the corruption and
other abuses pervading the administration of justice in
Sardinia, as lying at the root of its greatest social evil. It
is the ready excuse for rude justice, for private revenge,
for the assertion of the rights of persons or of things by
the strong hand, that the laws are inoperative, or iniquitously
administered. There is too much reason to believe
that this has been the normal state of Sardinia under all
its rulers for ages past. And when at the same time we
find the natural instincts of the people to be turbulent and
lawless, and prone to theft and robbery, and consider the
facilities afforded by a wild, mountainous, and densely
wooded country, for the commission of crimes of violence,
the scenes of bloodshed and rapine by which it has been
desolated, are not to be wondered at. In the absence of a
vigorous justice, and a sufficient military or police force
for the protection of property, a voluntary association
sprung up, consisting of armed men, under the name of
Barancelli, who, for a sort of black mail paid by the
peasants, undertook to recover their stolen cattle, or indemnify
them for the loss. They fell, however, into disrepute,
and I believe have been disbanded. Banditism has
been finally and effectually extinguished in Corsica, as
related in a former part of this work, by a total disarmament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
of the population, without respect of persons, or of
the purposes for which fire-arms may be properly required.
So stern a measure is neither suited to the genius of the
Sardes or their rulers. With a numerous resident gentry,
who, with their retainers, and the great mass of the population,
are passionately fond of the chase, and with wastes
so stocked with destructive wild animals, the total prohibition
of fire-arms must be both unpopular and impolitic.
The law, however, requires that no one shall carry them
without a license. But it is not, or cannot be, enforced,
for we saw them in every one's hands.</p>

<p>It gave me great pleasure to learn, as it has been
already stated, on a recent visit to Sardinia, that the
administration of the law was become more pure, the police
improved, outrages were less frequent, and confident
hopes entertained that banditism, now confined to a small
number of outlaws, would gradually die out. There is no
doubt it will do so when the laws are respected as in other
parts of the Sardinian dominions.</p>

<p>In regard to the judges and other civil functionaries, we
found everywhere the deepest antipathy towards the Piedmontese.
Sardinia for the Sardes, was like the cry we
often hear from our own sister island. Sala treats the
subject with his usual temper and good sense. He admits
the advantages of an administration conducted by natives
possessing a knowledge of the country, conversant with
its language and customs, and of a temper more conciliatory
than foreigners invested with authority are likely to
exhibit. He also admits that there is extreme mediocrity,
and even ignorance, in the lower class of functionaries
who arrive in the island with appointments obtained in
Turin or Genoa. Sala relates a ludicrous story of one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
these officials, who chanced to be his companion in the
steam-boat from Genoa to Cagliari, being recommended to
the Intendant-General as the chief of a department under
him. When half-way across, the candidate for office had
yet to learn whither they were bent,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Si fece interrogarci
per dove possimo diretti</i>.&rdquo; Afterwards, says Sala, when
chatting in Cagliari, he reproached the Sardes with ignorance
and indolence because, though their land was surrounded
by the sea, they did not know how to supply
themselves with a river,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Non sapevano formarsi un
fiume</i>;&rdquo; adding, with great self-complacency,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Li civilizzeremo,
li civilizzeremo!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such impertinences are calculated to irritate the native
Sardes against the continental officials; and they are generally
detested. Our author, however, candidly allows that
intrigue prevails so universally in the island, and the influences
of relationship and connexions are so great, as to
raise suspicions of the purity and fairness of native functionaries,
especially of those who have been brought up
under the old system,&mdash;a school of corruption. Signor
Sala therefore suggests, that while appointments, both on
the continent and the island, should be equally open to
competent candidates, without respect of birth, great
advantages would be obtained by this interchange. The
Sardes being habituated by residence for a while, and the
transaction of business, on Terra Firma; and thus withdrawn
from unfavourable influences, would be prepared to
fill honourably offices at home. This seems a wise and
obvious mode of abating a grievance of which the Sardes
not unjustly complain.</p>

<p>Having mentioned before the gigantic evil of the vast
extent of commonage claimed and exercised throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
island, destructive of the rights of property and quite incompatible
with agricultural progress, I have only to add that
measures are contemplated for facilitating and protecting
inclosures where lawfully made; but so as not to injure the
great interest of the proprietors of flocks and herds, the
staple production of the island. In this view it is proposed
to place the great domains of the communes under
better management.</p>

<p>Among various other reforms and beneficial projects to
which the attention of a more enlightened government
must be directed, in order to raise Sardinia to the rank she
is entitled to hold by the extent of her resources, and the
intelligence of great numbers of her inhabitants, we can
only enumerate, without observation, the educational
system generally, including a reform of the Universities of
Cagliari and Sassari,&mdash;sanitary measures tending, at least,
to alleviate the insalubrity which is the scourge of the
island,&mdash;improved police arrangements throughout the
interior,&mdash;an increased supply of the circulating medium,
the deficiency of which is represented as extreme and
injurious to trade, and &ldquo;Agrarian Banks;&rdquo;&mdash;an entire new
system of communal roads, connected with the great
national highways, which roads, it is said, would double
the value of property wherever they passed,&mdash;the protection
and careful administration of the forests,&mdash;measures for
developing the great mineral wealth of the island,&mdash;and the
encouragement of the coral fisheries.</p>

<p>Nor have we exhausted the list; but enough has been
shown to satisfy the reader who accepts the statements we
have laid before him, from our own observation and from
the best information of the capabilities of Sardinia and its
present condition,&mdash;how much is required to place her on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
a footing with other European states, and with what hope
of eventual success. A vast field is, indeed, open for
cultivation by an enlightened and patriotic administration.
Great difficulties will have to be encountered, arising
mainly from the indolence, the supineness, the prejudices,
the ignorance, and the poverty of the Sarde population.
The progress must be gradual, but noble will be the
reward earned by that exercise of vigour, discretion, and
perseverance, by which the obstacles to improvement may
be overcome.</p>

<p>There is one highly gifted man, who has long filled a
distinguished place in the service of his sovereign and
the eyes of the world, in whose hands the task of regenerating
Sardinia, herculean as it may appear, would be
not only a labour of love, but facile comparatively with any
others on which it may devolve. I speak of General the
Count Alberto di Marmora, known to all Europe by his
Topographical Survey, and his able work, the <i>Voyage en
Sardaigne</i>, of which two additional volumes have been
recently published. But, perhaps, his devotion to the best
interests of the Sarde people, his labours in that cause,
and the esteem and affection with which he is universally
regarded in the island are less understood. Enjoying also
the confidence of the king and his ministers, General La
Marmora is eminently fitted to carry out the beneficial
designs which he has long conceived and furthered; but
his advanced age precludes the hope of his seeing them
accomplished. May his mantle fall on no unworthy
successor!</p>

<p>One subject of special interest in connection with Sardinian
progress has been reserved for a more particular
notice than we have been able to afford most others, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
on account of its importance, and its having much engaged
the attention of the master-mind most conversant with
the situation of affairs. At the outset of our rambles in
Sardinia, it was observed that the Sardes are averse to
maritime occupations; the Iliese of La Madelena, who
are so employed to some extent, being a distinct race.
Sardinia has no mercantile marine. Signor Sala states
that there are only four or five vessels belonging to
natives, and, of these, two are the property of the same
rich owner. Considering the advantages of her position,
and the products the island is capable of supplying for
an active commerce, he considers the want of a mercantile
marine one of Sardinia's greatest misfortunes, and treats
with much good sense of the means calculated to promote
its establishment.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>General La Marmora drew attention to the subject in a
pamphlet published at Cagliari in 1850, under the title of
<i>Questioni marittimi spettanti all'isola di Sardegna</i>; and
resumed the subject in 1856, in another work, which he was
so obliging as to give me, when at Cagliari, in 1857. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
originated in the expected completion of the line of Electric
Telegraph between Algeria, Sardinia, Corsica, and the
continent of Europe; its connexion with which, and its
bearings on commerce, I may have to refer to on a future
occasion. The General comments on the extraordinary fact,
that, in an island 800 miles in circumference, there only
exist four sea-ports, properly so called. These are Cagliari,
on the south coast, Terranova, on the east, Porto-Torres, on
the north, and Alghero on the west. All the other villages
and towns on the coast stand more or less distantly from it,
and cannot be called maritime. He considers this depopulation
of the coast as the deplorable consequence of the
devastations of the Saracen corsairs, and the continual
piracy which was carried on to a late period, and only
ceased on the conquest of Algeria by the French.</p>

<p>It would be foreign to our province to detail the projects
which General La Marmora suggests, or advocates, for
giving expansion to the commerce of Sardinia,&mdash;such as
the establishment of light-houses on Cape Spartivento, and
other points; improvements in the harbour of Cagliari, and
a better supply of the place with water. He considers the
now almost deserted town and port of Terranova, at the
head of the fine gulf <i>Degli Aranci</i>, on the north-eastern
coast, to be a point of great importance from its position in
face of the Italian ports, and as the proper station for the
postal steamboats communicating between Genoa and the
island of Sardinia. In reference to this, he mentions that
the project of a law for encouraging colonisation in the
island, was presented by the Minister to the Chamber of
Deputies in February, 1856; the proposal being to grant
60,000 hectares of the national domains to a company
formed for establishing agrarian colonies. The cabinet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
Turin, then, are alive to one of the great wants of Sardinia,&mdash;an
increased and industrious agricultural population. But
General La Marmora desires that a part of the colonists
should be maritime, drawn from La Madalena, Genoa, and
other ports, and settled at the proposed new harbour of
Terranova.</p>

<p>By these and other aids, the General is sanguine that
Sardinia will, ere long, take the place naturally belonging
to it among maritime countries, and he repeats as a motto
to his recent pamphlet, a sentence from the first edition of
his <i>Voyage en Sardaigne</i>, published in 1826, to which, he
remarks, recent events have almost given the character of
a prediction in the course of speedy accomplishment:&mdash;<i>Qui
sait si un jour, par suite des progr&egrave;s que fait depuis
quelque temps l'Egypte moderne, le commerce des Indes
Orientales ne prendra pas la route de la Mer-Rouge et de
Suez? La Sardaigne, alors, ne pourrait-elle pas devenir la
plus belle et la plus commode &eacute;chelle de la M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e?</i></p>

<p>The cabinet of Turin and the national legislature must
be well disposed to foster the commerce and agriculture,
the natural resources, and social interests of the Sardes.
Should the Ministers be negligent or ill-advised, the representatives
of the people, or, in the last resort, the Sarde
constituencies, have their constitutional remedy. British
institutions are said to be models imitated in the young
commonwealth. They present similar features; and let
it be recollected what influence either the Irish or the
Scotch members, acting in concert in our House of Commons,
can bring to bear on any question affecting the
interests of their respective countries. The Sardes return
twenty-four deputies to the popular chamber, and if they
be good men and true, inaccessible to intrigue, and find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
in their patriotism a bond of union, their united votes
cannot be disregarded by any Minister.</p>

<p>How different is the case of Corsica, the sister island!
In reviewing her industrial position we quoted rather
largely from a <i>Proc&egrave;s-Verbal</i> of the deliberations of the
Council-General, also an elective body, which canvasses,
but not regulates, the internal administration of the island.
It arrives at certain conclusions, but without any power to
give them effect. &ldquo;Le Conseil-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral &eacute;met le v&#339;u,&rdquo;
&ldquo;appelle l'attention,&rdquo; are the phrases wherewith, with bated
breath, the representatives of the people convey their
resolutions to the foot of the throne. The courtly Prefect
communicates them to the Minister of the Interior, and
he, the organ of the Imperial will, rejects, confirms, or
modifies the &ldquo;v&#339;u.&rdquo; The Sarde representatives meet the
Ministers face to face in the Parliament at Turin, demand,
discuss, explain, remonstrate, carry their point, or are
content to yield to a majority of the Chamber. With a
free press, the public learns all; public opinion ratifies or
condemns the vote. It will prevail in the end. Herein
lies the difference between a despotic and a popular government.
A bright day dawned on the future destinies of
Sardinia, when it exchanged the one for the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

Student's private Cabinet.&mdash;Excursion to a
Nuraghe&mdash;Description of.&mdash;Remarks on the Origin and
Design of these Structures</i>.</p>

<p>Sassari is about equidistant from Alghero and Porto-Torres.
Of these two ports Alghero is far the best, but all the
commerce of Sassari passes through Porto-Torres, by the
Strada Reale. The ancient rivalry between the two cities
engendered a hatred which continues to the present day,
insomuch that the Sassarese have resisted all efforts to
make a good road from Alghero, to enable it to become
their port of trade. These feuds arose in the age when
Alghero was the chief seat of the Arragonese power in
the island, enjoyed great exclusive privileges, and was
peopled by Catalonian settlers. It is still Spanish in the
character of the inhabitants, their customs, and buildings.
Surrounded by a fertile and well-cultivated country,
abounding in orange and olive groves, vineyards, and
fields of corn and flax, Alghero is a city of some seven
thousand inhabitants, many of them in affluent circumstances.
It is a fortified place, with a richly ornamented
cathedral, and thirteen other churches.</p>

<p>Sassari also boasts a spacious cathedral, with a very
elaborate fa&ccedil;ade, a work of the 17th century. It contains
also twenty churches, including those that are conventual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
If the religious state of the community were to be estimated
by the number of those devoted to the service of
the church, the Sassarese ought to be models of piety; for
Mr. Tyndale calculates the number of priests and monks
in 1840 as giving a total of 769 clerical persons, about one
for every thirty-two individuals of the community. Their
numbers have been diminished by the suppression of
some of the convents, but, even at the time of our visit,
his remark, that one cannot walk fifty yards in the street
without meeting an ecclesiastic, was confirmed by our own
observation.</p>

<p>The object which the Sassarese are most proud to exhibit
to strangers, is the fountain of Rosello, outside the north-east
or Macella gate. At the angles are large figures of
the four seasons, at the feet of which the stream issues
forth, as well as from eight lions' mouths in the sides of
the building. The whole is of white marble, and though
open to criticism as an architectural design, the utility of
a fountain, which has twelve mouths constantly pouring
forth pure water, in such a climate, cannot be overrated.</p>

<p>The University of Sassari, founded by Philip IV. in
1634, is established in the spacious college formerly
belonging to the Jesuits. It numbers about 200 students.
The library contains a scanty collection of books, mostly
ecclesiastical works. The museum exhibits some few
articles of interest, relics of the Ph&#339;nician colonisation
and Roman occupation of the island, mixed up in the
greatest confusion, as in a broker's shop, with meagre
specimens of mineralogy and conchology; and cannot for
a moment be compared with the museum of Cagliari, rich
in valuable remains of antiquity, and admirably arranged.
It will be noticed in its proper place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>We were much more interested in being allowed to
examine a small private collection belonging to a young
Sassarese, whose acquaintance it was our good fortune
to make, and of whose talents, intelligence, and courtesy
I retain a most pleasing impression. The pursuits of the
young men of the higher classes in Sassari, are described
as entirely frivolous, and the bent of the bourgeoisie as
eminently sordid. It was, therefore, with an agreeable
surprise, that we found ourselves in a studio embellished
with the portraits of such characters as Dante, Ariosto,
and Sir Isaac Newton; and where mathematical instruments,
scattered about, and a cabinet containing some of
the best French, English, German, and Italian authors,
gave a pleasing idea of the tastes of the owner. With
imperfect aid he had made himself sufficiently proficient
in foreign languages to be able to read them; and it
appeared that his severer studies were relieved by accomplishments
displaying considerable talent, such as painting,
and taking impressions from the antique in electrotype.
He was good enough to offer me some of his casts, with
a few coins from his museum of antiquities; two engravings
from which, illustrating the Punic and Saracenic periods
of the history of Sardinia, will appear in future pages, together
with one copied from a unique coin of the Roman
age, preserved in the Royal Museum at Cagliari.</p>

<p>One seldom finds such talents and accomplishments
accompanied by the modesty with which our young student
spoke of his pursuits. Nor was he a mere recluse, though
his health appeared feeble; for he entered with zest into
conversation on the various topics of European interest
suggested by a visit from foreigners, while he did not
hesitate to expose, with patriotic zeal, the follies and abuses
which opposed the march of civilisation in his native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
country. Such characters are rare. We had unexpectedly
stumbled on a delicate flower, nurtured on an ungrateful
soil, and destined to shed its sweetness in an atmosphere
where, I fear, it is little appreciated. I may be excused,
then, for devoting a page to the adventure, and allowed to
inscribe on that page, a name of which I have so agreeable
a recollection&mdash;that of Carlo Rugiu.</p>

<p>Our new friend was kind enough to be our conductor in
a walk to a Nuraghe, standing about three miles from
Sassari, and in good preservation. We had already seen
many of these very ancient structures scattered over all
parts of the country; more or less ruinous, they are said
to number 3000 at the present day, and many others have
been destroyed.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/379.jpg" width="350" height="266" alt="EXTERIOR OF A NURAGHE."
title="EXTERIOR OF A NURAGHE." />
<p class="caption">EXTERIOR OF A NURAGHE.</p>
</div>

<p>Whether seen on the plains or on the mountains, the
Nuraghe are generally built on the summits of hillocks, or
on artificial mounds, commanding the country. Some are
partially inclosed at a slight distance by a low wall of
similar construction with the building. Their external
appearance is that of a
truncated cone from
thirty to sixty feet in
height, and from 100
to 300 in circumference
at the base. The
walls are composed of
rough masses of the
stones peculiar to the
locality, each from two
to six cubic feet, built in regular horizontal layers, in
somewhat of the Cyclopean style, and gradually diminishing
in size to the summit. Most commonly they betray no
marks of the chisel, but in many instances the stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
appear to have been rudely worked by the hammer, though
not exactly squared.</p>

<p>The interior is almost invariably divided into two domed
chambers, one above the other; the lowest averaging from
fifteen to twenty feet in diameter, and from twenty to
twenty-five feet in height. Access to the upper chamber
is gained by a spiral ramp, or rude steps, between the internal
and external walls. These are continued to the
summit of the tower, which is generally supposed to have
formed a platform; but scarcely any of the Nuraghe now
present a perfect apex. On the ground floor, there are
generally from two to four cells worked in the solid masonry
of the base of the cone.</p>

<p>Independently of the interest attached to the object of
our search, the fertile plains surrounding Sassari formed a
sufficient attraction for a long walk. Plantations of olives,
of vines, oranges, and other fruit-trees, succeeded each
other in rich profusion; the olive trees being especially
productive, and the oil, exported from Sassari in large
quantities, being of the first quality. The environs, far
and wide, are laid out in these plantations, and in gardens
highly cultivated, interspersed with villas and pleasure-grounds.
Tobacco is largely cultivated, and the vegetables
are excellent. A cauliflower served up at dinner was of
enormous size, nor can I forget the baskets of delicious
figs which, at this late period of the year, were brought by
the market-women to the door of our hotel.</p>

<p>The Nuraghe to which our steps were directed proved to
be a very picturesque object, rising out of a thicket of
shrubs, with tufts growing in the crevices of the tower,
which on one side was dilapidated. The other, composed
of huge boulders, laid horizontally with much precision,
considering the rude materials, still preserved its conical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
form, rising to the height of twenty or twenty-five feet.
The entrance was so low that
we were obliged to stoop almost
to our knees in passing
through it. A lintel, consisting
of a single stone, some
two tons' weight, was supported
by the protruding
jambs. No light being admitted
to the chamber, but by
a low passage through the
double walls, it was gloomy
enough.</p>

title="INTERIOR OF A NURAGHE." />
<p class="caption">INTERIOR OF A NURAGHE.</p>
</div>

<p>In this instance, the interior
formed a single dome or
cone about twenty-five feet high, well-proportioned, and
diminishing till a single massive stone formed the apex.
The chamber was fifteen feet
in diameter, and had four recesses
or cells worked in the
solid masonry, about five feet
high, three deep, and nearly
the same in breadth.</p>

<p>The small platform on the
summit of the cone, to which
we ascended by the ramp in
the interior of the wall and
some rugged steps, commanded
a rich view of the plain of
Sassari, appearing from the
top one dense thicket of olive
and fruit trees spreading for miles round the city. Out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
these groves rise the towers and domes of Sassari, the
enceinte of its grey battlemented walls, and the lofty
masses of its white houses. The view over the plain to
the west is bounded by the Mediterranean, intersected by
the bold outlines of the island of Asmara. After feasting
our eyes on perhaps the most charming <i>tableau</i> the island
affords, decked with nature's choicest gifts, and exhibiting
an industry unusual among the modern Sardes, we sat
down at the foot of the hillock, while my friend was completing
his sketches of the Nuraghe, and our thoughts were
naturally drawn to these relics of a primitive age. &ldquo;What
was their origin&mdash;their history&mdash;what were the purposes
for which they were designed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It needed only that we should lift our eyes to the rude
but shapely cone before us,&mdash;massive in its materials and
fabric, and yet constructed with some degree of mechanical
skill,&mdash;to come to the conclusion that the Nuraghe are
works of a very early period, just when rude labour had
begun to be directed by some rules of geometrical art.
But, in examining the details, we find little or nothing to
assist us in forming any clear idea of the period at which
they were erected, or the purpose for which they were
designed. There are not the slightest vestiges of ornament,
any rude sculpture, any inscriptions. Of an antiquity
probably anterior to all written records, history not
only throws no certain light on their origin, but, till modern
times, was silent as to their existence. Successive races,
and powers, and dynasties have flourished in the island, and
passed away, scarcely any of them without leaving some
relics, some medals of history, some impress on the manners
and character of the people still to be traced. The
mouldering cones which arrest the traveller's attention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
scattered, as we have observed, in great numbers throughout
the island, enduring in their simple and massive structure,
have thrown their shade over Ph&#339;nicians and Greeks,
Romans and Carthaginians, Saracens, Pisans, Genoese,
and Spaniards, and still survive the wreck of time and so
many other early buildings,&mdash;the remains of a people of
whose existence they are the only record, and, except
monoliths, the oldest of, at least, European monuments.</p>

<p>In the absence of any positive evidence regarding the
origin and design of the Sardinian Nuraghe<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>, there has
been abundance of conjecture and speculation on the subject.
On the present occasion, I had the advantage of discussing
it with our intelligent Sassarese student, I have also
heard the remarks of one of the most distinguished Sarde
antiquarians, and having since consulted the works of La
Marmora and other writers, whose extensive researches
and personal investigations entitle their opinions to much
respect, I shall endeavour to lay the result, unsatisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
as it proves, before the reader, in the shortest compass to
which so wide an inquiry can be reduced.</p>

<p>The world has been searched for styles of building corresponding
with that of the Sarde Nuraghe; without success.
Neither in Etruscan, Pelasgic, or any other European
architecture are any such models to be found, nor do
Indian, Assyrian, or Egyptian remains exhibit any identity
with them. They have been supposed, among other
theories, to have some affinity with the Round Towers of
Ireland; but after a careful examination of some of those
almost equally mysterious structures, and considerable
research among the authorities for their antiquity and
uses, I have failed to discover anything in common between
them and the Nuraghe. If my memory be correct, Mr.
Petrie, the highest authority on the subject of the Round
Towers, though he had not seen the Nuraghe, incidentally
expresses the same opinion. The only existing buildings
exhibiting a cognate character with those of Sardinia, are
certain conical towers found in the Balearic islands, which
were also colonised by the Ph&#339;nicians. They are called
<i>talayots</i>, a diminutive, it is said, of <i>atalaya</i>, meaning the
&ldquo;Giants' Burrow;&rdquo; and if the plate annexed to Father
Bresciani's work be a correct representation, they would
appear to be identical with the Nuraghe in the exterior,
except that the ramp leading to the summit is worked in
the outward face of the wall. We find, also, from La Marmora's
description of the <i>talayots</i> examined by him, that
the character of the cells is different, the style of masonry
more cyclopean, and that many of them are surrounded
with circles of stones and supposed altars, scarcely ever met
with in Sardinia. The resemblance, however, is striking, as
connected with the facts of the contiguity of Minorca, and
the colonisation of both the islands by the Ph&#339;nicians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>Opinions as to the purposes for which the Nuraghe were
erected are as various as those regarding their origin.
From their great number, scattered over the country, they
are supposed by some to have been the habitations of the
most ancient shepherds; and the words of Micah&mdash;&ldquo;the
tower of the flocks,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and other similar passages, are referred
to as supporting this view. But it is hardly necessary
to point out that the inconveniences of the structure,
from its low entrance and dark interior, to say nothing of
the waste of labour in heaping up such vast structures for
shepherds' huts, will not admit of the idea being entertained.
With somewhat more reason, but still with little
probability, they have been represented as watch-towers,
strongholds, and places of refuge; a theory to which their
position, their numbers, and their structure are all opposed.
Another hypothesis treats the Nuraghe as monuments
commemorating heroes or great national events, whether
in peace or war; forgetting, as Father Bresciani suggests,
the centuries that must have elapsed while the mountains,
and hills, and plains of Sardinia were being successively
crowned with monuments of this description.</p>

<p>Discarding such conjectural theories, the best-informed
travellers and writers are agreed in considering the Nuraghe
as being designed either for religious edifices or tombs
for the dead. La Marmora confesses his inability to pronounce
decidedly between the two opinions, but inclines
to the opinion that they may have been intended for both
purposes. Father Bresciani, the latest writer on Sardinian
antiquities, after a personal examination of the Nuraghe
and much general research, though he does not venture a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
decided opinion, is disposed to agree with La Marmora.
In confirmation of the idea that the most ancient monuments
were at once tombs and altars, he quotes a Spanish
writer<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> on the antiquities of Mexico, referring also to Lord
Kingsborough's splendid work. So general an assumption
is hardly warranted either by historical testimony or existing
relics of antiquity. If such were the primitive custom,
it did not prevail among the Greeks and Romans, and it
is in the rites and practices of the Christian Church that
we find its revival.</p>

<p>However this may be, the theory not only of the twofold
design or use of the Nuraghe, but of either of them, is confessedly
quite conjectural: it rests upon a narrow basis of
facts. Though a great number of the Nuraghe have been
carefully ransacked, in very few instances only have human
bones been discovered, but neither urns, arms, nor ornaments
usually inhumed with the dead; nor are many of them
so constructed as to permit the supposition that they were
designed for sepulchral purposes. Occasionally, also, some
of the miniature idols, such as are preserved in the museum
at Cagliari, have been found buried in Nuraghe, or their
precincts. But this is not general; and there are neither
altars nor any other indications in the structure of the
buildings to indicate their appropriation to religious uses,
except their pyramidal or conical form, which they share
in common with most buildings of the earliest age. So
far as these were designed for idolatrous uses&mdash;as many of
them doubtless were&mdash;the argument from analogy may
apply to the Nuraghe, but it can be carried no further.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever were the purposes of the Nuraghe, almost all
writers on Sardinia consider these ancient structures of
Eastern origin. Father Bresciani attributes them to Canaanitish
or Ph&#339;nician colonies, which migrated to the
west in early times; and he takes great pains, but, I consider,
without much success, to establish their identity,
or, at least, their analogy, with the religious or sepulchral
erections,&mdash;the altars, and &ldquo;high places,&rdquo; and tombs,&mdash;of
which notices are found in the Old Testament. No doubt
exists that extensive migrations, favoured by the enterprise
of the earliest maritime people of whom we have any
record, took place, perhaps both before and after the age
of Moses, from the shores of Syria to the islands and
shores of the West of Europe. There is reason to think
that the island of Sardinia, if not the first seat, was, from
its peculiar situation, the very centre, of a colonisation,
embracing in its ramifications the coasts of Africa and
Spain, with Malta, Sicily, and the Balearic islands. It
appears singular that Corsica, the sister island to Sardinia,
should not have shared in this movement of settlers from
the East; perhaps from its lying out of the direct current,
while, in its onward course, the wave flowing through
the Straits of Hercules bore forward on the ocean the
&ldquo;merchants of many isles,&rdquo; for commerce if not for settlement,
as far as the Cassiterides, our own Scilly Isles.</p>

<p>Though there is little historical evidence of the Ph&#339;nician
colonisation of Sardinia, and even that of the early Greek
settlements in the island is obscure and conflicting, we
have abundant traces of the former, more imperishable
than written records, still lingering in the manners and
customs of the modern Sardes, and in the great number of
those extraordinary antiquities known as the Sarde idols.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
The greater part of these, as Mr. Tyndale undertakes to
show, were symbols of Canaanitish worship, the miniature
representations of the gods adored by the Syrian nations,
especially of Moloch, Baal, Astarte or Astaroth, Adonis or
Tammuz, the very objects of that idolatry so frequently
and emphatically denounced in the Old Testament, to
which we have already referred. Mr. Tyndale, however,
justly observes, that &ldquo;so distinct and peculiar is the character
of these relics, that their counterparts are no more
to be met with out of Sardinia than the Nuraghe themselves.&rdquo;
From this circumstance, in conjunction with the
fact of the images being often found in and near those
buildings, he infers that they may have been, directly or
indirectly, connected with each other, in either a religious,
sepulchral, or united character.</p>

<p>The inquiry would be incomplete unless it were extended
to other Sarde remains, of equal or greater antiquity, for
the purpose of discovering whether they have any affinity
with, or can throw any light on, the mysterious origin of
the Nuraghe. We propose devoting another chapter to
this investigation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>We can hardly be mistaken in supposing that, among the
relics of antiquity still existing in Sardinia, the monoliths,
of somewhat similar character with the Celtic remains at
Carnac, Avebury, and Stonehenge, and common also in
other countries, belong to the earliest age. These Sarde
monoliths are found in several parts of the island, being, as
the name expresses, single stones, or obelisks, set upright
in the ground. In Sardinia they are called <i>Pietra-</i> or
<i>Perda-fitta</i>, and <i>Perda-Lunga</i>. We generally find them
rounded by the hammer, but irregularly, in a conical form
tapering to the top, but with a gradual swell in the middle;
and their height varies from six to eighteen feet. They
differ from the Celtic monuments, in being generally thus
worked and shaped; in not being often congregated on one
spot beyond three in number&mdash;a <i>Perda-Lunga</i> with two
lesser stones; and in there not being any appearance of
their ever having had, like the Trilithons of Stonehenge,
any impost horizontal stone.</p>

<p>Father Bresciani finds the prototype of all these rude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
pillars scattered throughout the world, in the Beth-El of
Jacob and other Bethylia, sepulchral or commemorative,
mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures. By Mr. Tyndale,
the Sarde <i>Perda-Lunga</i> is considered a relic of the religion
common to all the idolatrous Syro-Arabian nations, which,
deifying the powers and laws of nature, considers the male
sex to be the type of its active, generative, and destructive
powers, while that passive power of nature, whose function
is to conceive and bring forth, is embodied under the
female form. And this worship, he conceives, was introduced
into Sardinia, with the symbols just described, by
the Ph&#339;nician or Canaanitish immigrants.</p>

<p class="caption">SEPOLTURA DE IS GIGANTES.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Sepolture de is Gigantes</i>, the tombs of the giants,
as they are called, form another class of Sarde antiquities
of the earliest age. The structures to which the popular
traditions ascribe this name, may be described as a series
of large stones placed together without any cement, inclosing
a foss or hollow from fifteen to thirty-six feet long,
from three to six wide,
and the same in depth,
with immense flat stones
resting on them as a covering.
Though the latter
are not always found,
it is evident, by a comparison
with the more perfect
Sepolture, that they
have once existed, and
have been destroyed or removed.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>The foss runs invariably from north-west to south-east;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
and at the latter point there is a large upright headstone,
averaging from ten to fifteen feet high, varying in its form,
from the square, elliptical, and conical, to that of three-fourths
of an egg; and having in many instances an
aperture about eighteen inches square at its base.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/391.jpg" width="250" height="177" alt="SEPOLTURA DE IS GIGANTES."
title="SEPOLTURA DE IS GIGANTES." />
<p class="caption">SEPOLTURA DE IS GIGANTES.</p>
</div>

<p>On each side of this stele, or headstone, commences
a series of separate stones, irregular in size and shape,
but forming an arc, the
chord of which varies
from twenty to twenty-six
feet; so that the
whole figure somewhat
resembles the bow and
shank of a spur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The shape of the
foss and headstone,&rdquo; observes
Mr. Tyndale, &ldquo;of
these remains, fairly admits of the probability that they
were graves, as some of the earliest forms of sepulchres
on record are the upright stones with superincumbent
slabs, such as the Druidical cistvaens and some tombs
in Greece. Still, like the &#8216;Sarde Idols&#8217; and the Nuraghe,
the <i>Sepolture</i> are peculiar to the island, being
entirely different in point of size and character from any
other sepulchral remains. Judging from the many remains
of those partially destroyed, their numbers must
have been considerable. The Sardes believe them to be
veritable tombs of giants; and that there may be legends
of their existence in the island is undeniable, as a similar
belief is found in almost all countries.&rdquo; Mr. Tyndale, in
speaking of the supposed connexion between the <i>Nuraghe</i>
and the <i>Sepolture</i>, observes that, &ldquo;if a Canaanitish race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
migrated here, nothing is more probable than that the
tradition and worship of the giants would be also imported;
and that it is even possible that some of the
actual gigantic races of the Rephaim, Anakim, and others
mentioned in Scripture, might have actually arrived in
Sardinia.&rdquo; Father Bresciani goes further: he fixes the
era of this migration, points out the event which caused
it<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>, and traces its route by the Isthmus of Suez, through
Egypt, and along the coast of Africa, which they are also
said to have colonised; and whence he considers they could
easily navigate to Sardinia and other islands in that part
of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>This immigration, however, of the Canaanitish giants
rests upon very slender evidence; and it may be questioned
whether the oldest Sardinian monuments do not belong to
an age far anterior to that of any Ph&#339;nician or Canaanitish
colonisation of the island whatever. That such there was,
undoubted proofs have already been gathered; but the
statuettes of Ph&#339;nician idols, forming part of those proofs,
with the arts and skill required for the maritime enterprise
it required, betray the civilisation of a period more advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
than that to which we should be disposed to attribute
such rude structures as the Nuraghe and the
Sepolture. In this uncertainty, it may be worth an
inquiry, whether these ancient monuments did not exist
before the colonists landed on the shores of Sardinia,&mdash;in
short, whether they were not the works of an aboriginal
race. The question is raised by M. Tyndale: &ldquo;We may
reduce the inquiry,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to the simple question,
Were the Nuraghe built by the autochthones of the island,
of whom we have no knowledge, or by the earliest colonists,
of whom we have but little information?&rdquo; On the former
alternative the author is silent; nor is the question even
raised by any other writer on Sardinian antiquities within
our knowledge.</p>

<p>Yet surely, independently of its bearing on the origin
of the Nuraghe and the early population of Sardinia, the
subject of indigenous races is interesting in a general point
of view. And it is worthy of notice, that the accounts
handed down to us of the earliest colonists of the ancient
world, speak of an aboriginal population existing in the
countries to which they migrated, just as the European
adventurers and circumnavigators of the last three centuries
found indigenous races on the continents and islands
they discovered, except on some few islands of the Pacific
Ocean, recently emerged from the state of coral reefs.
The parallel may be carried further. The ancient, as well
as the modern, colonists carried the arts of a superior
civilisation in their train; but the indigenous races of the
New World were destined to gradual decay and extinction,
leaving some ancient monuments as the records of their
existence, just as the primitive children of the soil in the
West of Europe, whose relics we endeavour to decipher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
disappeared and were lost; so uniform is the order of events
in the designs of Providence.</p>

<p>Poetical legends, generally founded on, and blended
with, traditionary facts, help us to form some idea of the
character and habits of the aboriginal races; but history,
and even tradition, seldom carry us further back in the
review of past ages than the arrival of colonists, generally
of Eastern origin, to form settlements on the shores and
the islands washed by the Mediterranean. Did they find
these shores and islands uninhabited? To say nothing of
countries more remote and less accessible, many considerations
would induce us to imagine that these fair regions
were not all deserts; that, even at this early period, they
were already peopled.</p>

<p>In Sardinia, where, as already observed, the manners,
the superstitions, and the traditions of the earliest ages,
are more faithfully preserved than in any other European
country, we find, among the most ancient existing structures,
some which, to this day, are pointed out by the
natives as &ldquo;the Tombs of the Giants.&rdquo; And who were
the &ldquo;giants,&rdquo; of whom we read much, both in sacred and
profane history? The very term is significant. It is
formed from two Greek words&mdash;&#947;&#8134; and &#947;&#941;&#957;&#969;, and signifies
earth-born, sons of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The word &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#967;&#952;&#957;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#962; (autochthones)
has a cognate meaning; Liddell and Scott
render it, &ldquo;of the land itself; Latin, <i>terrigen&aelig;, aborigines,
indigen&aelig;</i>, of the original race, <i>not settlers</i>.&rdquo; The mythical
account of the origin of the &ldquo;giants&rdquo; concurs with this
etymology. It paints them as the sons of C&#339;lus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
Terra&mdash;Heaven and Earth. In the poetry of Hesiod, they
spring from the earth imbued with the blood of the gods.
Traces and traditions of this aboriginal race are found in
all parts of the world, and in sacred as well as profane
history. We are told that there were giants in the days
before the flood<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>; and Josephus considers them the offspring
of the union, mysteriously described by the sacred
writer, of &ldquo;the sons of God with the daughters of men;&rdquo;
for, as might be supposed, there were females also of the
race of the earth-born. So the poets sang. Such was
Cybele, daughter of Heaven and Earth, pictured as
crowned with a diadem of towers, as the patroness of
builders. We read of the giants, in the Old Testament,
under the names of Rephaim, Emim, Zamzummim, and
Anakim. In the time of Abraham, these tribes dwelt in
the country beyond Jordan, in about Astaroth-Karnaim<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>,
and it is now the received opinion of biblical arch&aelig;ologists,
that they were the most ancient, or aboriginal, inhabitants
of Palestine; prior to the Canaanites, by whom they were
gradually dispossessed of the region west of the Jordan,
and driven beyond that river. Some of the race, however,
remained in Palestine Proper so late as the invasion of the
land by the Hebrews, and are repeatedly mentioned as
&ldquo;the sons of Anak,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the remnant of the Rephaim;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
and a few families existed as late as the time of David.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>In the most ancient legends we find the giant race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
located in all parts of the then known world. In Thessaly,
under the name of Titans, poetic fiction records their deeds
of prowess in piling mountain on mountain, and hurling
immense rocks in their battles with the gods. Writers of
credit have transmitted to us accounts of the discovery of
their remains on the coast of Africa, from Bona to Tangier,
in Sicily, and in Crete. The earliest navigators who
touched on the shores and islands of the Mediterranean,
brought back romantic tales, receiving their colouring
from the terrors of the narrators, of the barbarity and the
stature of the races they found on those then inhospitable
shores. They were robbers, and even cannibals; enemies
of the gods and men. Such tales are not without their
parallels in the annals of modern maritime discovery.</p>

<p>Before the fall of Troy, Sicily was peopled by a giant or
aboriginal people, called Cyclopes; that insular race being
said to be descended from Neptune and Amphitrite, just as
the giant Ant&aelig;us, the founder of Tangier on the African
coast, was called the son of Neptune and Terra. If we
take Polyphemus, the chief of a tribe of the Cyclops, for a
type of this cognate race, what do we find in his story,
divested of the fiction with which it was clothed by
tradition, transmuted into the poetry of the Odyssey and
the &AElig;neid? The Grecian and Trojan heroes, successively
land on the eastern coast of Sicily, near the base of
Mount &AElig;tna, whose throes and thunders lend horror to
the scene. There dwelt this Cyclop chief, in a cavern of
the rocks. The race were Troglodytes, as were the aboriginal
Sardes, Baleares, Maltese, Libyans, &amp;c. In Sardinia,
their caverns are still to be seen in an island of the territory
of Sulcis. Caves were probably the first habitations
of primitive man, before emerging from a condition hardly
superior to that of the savage beasts, his competitors for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
such rude shelter. Irrespective of climate, in these we
find his home, whether among the Celts of the frozen
regions of the North, or the Arabs of the stony wastes
bordering on the Erythrean Sea, in the Libyan deserts,
or in the sandstone rocks of Southern Africa. There
one still sees the pygmy Bushmen, perhaps the last existing
Troglodyte race, the very reverse of the Cyclops in
stature, but, like them, their hand against every man's,
unchanged by ages in the midst of African tribes of considerable
civilisation, neither sowing nor pasturing, but
living on roots, berries, and grubs, like other aboriginal
races, which sprang into existence with the forests through
which they roam, and the various brutes which shared
with them the possession of the soil:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Cum prorepserunt primis animalia terris,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mutum et turpe pecus.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Hor.</span> <i>Sat.</i> i. 3.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the traditions of Polypheme and his Cyclops represent
them as advanced beyond this first rude stage of
society, though they still adhered to their ancestral caves.
They were robbers, no doubt; at least, they plundered
and made captive unfortunate mariners thrown on their
shores. Perhaps they feasted on their captives, as American
Indians and South-Sea islanders are reported to have done.
This may be doubted; but at least the cannibal feasts of
the Sicilian aborigines were but <i>bonnes bouches</i> occasionally
thrown in their way. They had better means of subsistence.
Polypheme was a shepherd, and so were all his clan.
Picture him, as described by Virgil<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>, descending from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
mountains, probably at eventide, leaning on his staff, with
his shepherd's pipe hanging on his bosom, surrounded by
his flocks, and leading them to the shelter of some cavern
on the shore; and we have a pleasant scene of pastoral
life. Such were all his tribe, a pretty numerous one,
comprising one hundred males, with their families, each
having a flock as large as their chiefs. They led a nomad
life, &ldquo;<i>errantes</i>&rdquo; between the mountain pastures and the
plains on the coast<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p>Now, if we may be allowed to separate these facts,
which seem genuine, from the fictions with which they
are blended, we find the aborigines of Sicily, though barbarous,
in a somewhat advanced stage of social life beyond
that when we are told they roamed in the woods and fed
on acorns. Such we may justly presume, divested of
poetical fiction, was the condition of the aborigines of the
neighbouring island of Sardinia, the largest in the Mediterranean
except Sicily, when the first foreign colonists
landed on its coast. And such, after the lapse of more
than thirty centuries, are the Sarde shepherds of the
present day, generally lawless, sometimes robbers, making
the caves of the rocks their shelter, and their flocks and
herds providing them with food and clothing. Tenacious,
above all other European races, of the traditions and customs
of their forefathers, when they point to structures of
the highest antiquity scattered on their native soil, and
call them &ldquo;<i>Sepolture de is Gigantes</i>&rdquo;&mdash;as we now have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
some idea what these giants were,&mdash;may we not find
reason to accept their tradition, and consider these monuments
as the tombs of the chiefs and first founders of
their aboriginal race.</p>

<p>Still, it may be objected that the ancient legends relating
to giants are too fabulous to admit of any sound theories
being built on them; and some have even gone so far as
to reject all the received accounts of families or tribes of
men of gigantic stature, as worthy only of the belief of
credulous ages. It may indeed be difficult to imagine
whole districts and countries peopled with gigantic races
so formidable that we can hardly conceive any other
people subsisting in contact with them. But that individuals,
and even families, of extraordinary stature and
strength existed in the earliest ages cannot be denied,
except by those who regard the narrative of Scripture as
equally fabulous with the fictions of the poets; although
the statements are literal and exact, occur in a variety of
incidental notices, and are confirmed by discoveries related
by authors of good repute.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>A solution of the difficulty may, perhaps, be found in the
consideration, that, as even now we find families and races
exceeding in stature and strength the average of mankind,
there is still more reason to believe in the existence of
such phenomena in the youth of the generations of man,
when a simple mode of life, abundance of nutritious food,
and a salubrious atmosphere, gave to all organic beings
huge and sinewy forms. Such might be the special privilege
of the Rephaim, and other tribes of which we read.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
But while the rank and file, as we may call them, of the
nation, though tall and robust, might not much exceed
the average height of the human species, the chiefs and
heroes who took their posts in the van of battle may have
attained the extraordinary dimensions recorded of them;
and, their numbers being magnified by terror and tradition,
the attributes of the class were extended to the whole
tribe. Thus the poets gave the name of Cyclops to all the
aboriginal inhabitants of Sicily, though the Cyclops, properly
so called, are represented by them as a single family,
sons, as before mentioned, of Neptune and Amphitrite.</p>

<p>That the <i>Sepolture de is Gigantes</i> may be considered the
tombs of the chiefs or heroes of the aboriginal inhabitants
of Sardinia seems to be generally allowed; and the opinion
receives some confirmation from a passage in Aristotle's
&ldquo;Physics,&rdquo; where, treating of the immutability of time,
notwithstanding our perception or unconsciousness of what
occurs, he incidentally illustrates his argument by the
expression:&mdash;&ldquo;So with those who are fabulously said to
sleep with the heroes in Sardinia, when they shall rise
up.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The best authorities being thus led to the conclusion
that the Sarde aborigines were a giant race, the question
remains whether the Nuraghe had the same origin as the
Sepolture; and, passing by some trivial objections to this
hypothesis, we are disposed to adopt Mr. Tyndale's conclusion,
that&mdash;&ldquo;the coincidence of two such peculiar monuments
in the same island, their non-existence elsewhere,
and their being both indicative of some abstract principle
of grandeur and power, practically carried out in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
construction, are strong reasons for the presumption that
they may have had some mutual reference to each other,&mdash;as
burying places, temples, and altars, and consequently
were works of the same times and the same people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be objected, with some show of reason,
that a people so rude and so primitive as the aborigines,
could not have possessed the skill required for the construction
of such buildings as the Nuraghe; so that they
must be assigned to a later age. But we are informed in
Genesis that, among some families of mankind, not only
useful, but ornamental, arts were taught before Noah's
flood!<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and, without instituting an inquiry how soon the
inventive and mechanical faculties of mankind were more
or less developed in various countries, we may venture to
assume that, before the historical period, before navigation
had conveyed the higher arts of civilisation to distant
shores, the aboriginal races, generally, were not incapable
of erecting the massive structures attributed to them by
universal tradition, and which, defying the ravages of time,
still remain the sole monuments of lost races, on which
the puzzled antiquary can hope to decipher the records of
their existence and condition.</p>

<p>To rear the lofty perpendicular monolith, to set up the
tall stele as the headstone of a grave, to lift and poise the
ponderous rocking-stone, to raise and fix the massive
impost of the trilithon, or the slab covering a sepoltura, a
cromlech, or a cistvaen; (for the remark applies to Celtic
as well as Mediterranean antiquities), to heap up, not
Pelion on Ossa, but untold loads of earth and stone to form
the conical tumulus over the chambers of the dead, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
build &ldquo;Cyclopean&rdquo; walls, and construct the cone of rude
but solid masonry, with its cavernous recesses,&mdash;all these
are the works we should just expect from races of mankind
when emerging from primitive barbarism, in the youth of
the species, and possessed of enormous strength of limb.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
Those who reared these works are supposed to have been
in possession of some knowledge of the pulley, the lever,
and the incline; but, after all, giant strength must have
been the main fulcrum for such operations. Had there
been ornament, sculpture, or inscriptions on these primeval
monuments, our thoughts might have been carried forward
to a later age, when colonisation from the East brought
in its train the arts which there first undoubtedly flourished.</p>

<p>That the Sardinian antiquities of the earliest age are
unique, that this is the case in other parts of the world,
every primitive people having, with certain resemblances,
a peculiar style in its ancient monuments, that none such
as these are found in the countries from whence the first
colonists migrated, nor are described in their records, are
facts strengthening the argument for their being of indigenous
origin. That the forms of these structures scattered
over the world are generally pyramidal, often rounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
and sometimes spiral, tells nothing to the contrary. The
cone, as Father Bresciani observes, was more graceful to
the eye, more easy of construction, more durable, and,
perhaps, connected with some mysterious ideas of Eternity,
or the circling course of the heavenly bodies. Such was
the form of the first great building on record, the Tower
of Babel, as we have it represented; the type in many
respects of the Sarde Nuraghe. Nor is it an unreasonable
conjecture that the alien people, mysteriously alluded to
in Genesis, as mixing with the children of God, having
seduced the most froward of the chosen race, were the
instigators and planners of the profane enterprise. &ldquo;Go
to &mdash;&#8212;,&rdquo; said a man to his neighbour, as the marginal
translation renders the passage,&mdash;&ldquo;let us make bricks,
let us build a tower whose top may reach to heaven.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;There were giants in those days,&rdquo;&mdash;men not only of
gigantic forms, but imbued with grand ideas. The structures
included among the number of their monuments are,
as just observed, &ldquo;indicative of some abstract principle of
grandeur and power, practically carried out in their construction.&rdquo;
In the strength of their might, the Titanic
race bade defiance to the deities of Olympus, with whom
they are poetically represented as combating; but that
does not preclude our supposing that, in common with
all the generations of man, however barbarous, the giant
races had their religious instincts, their altars, their rites.
Reverence, also, for the memories of their departed heroes,
of their progenitors, was a common feeling, most powerful
in the earliest times. In these two principles we trace the
ideas to which the mysterious monuments of the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Sardes owe their origin, and thence we arrive at a reasonable
conclusion respecting their object and uses.</p>

<p>Researches the most extended and the most profound,
have failed to penetrate the obscurity in which the mists
of ages have enveloped the origin of the primeval monuments
of all nations, and of the people who founded them.
Something may have been contributed towards the solution
of the difficulties surrounding the subject, if we have
been able to connect existing monuments with a rude race
of extraordinary strength, the supposed giant-builders of
those ancient structures. Such buildings we discover in
various parts of the world, varying in their details, but
similar as respects their simple but massive and durable
forms. Gigantic stature and strength of limb we consider
to have been the essential requisites, in the infancy of art,
for transporting and raising the ponderous materials; and
these properties were characteristics of the races of which,
and of their Herculean labours, we find everywhere corresponding
traditions.</p>

<p>In the absence of a satisfactory reply to the inquiry,
whence, when, or how the giant race reached Sardinia, we
are willing to accept the alternative, as regards the
founders of the Nuraghe and its other ancient monuments,
that these structures were the work of the autocthonoi,
the aboriginal inhabitants. But we embrace the theory in
a different sense from that in which it is proposed; suggesting
that the so-called giants themselves may have been
the autocthonoi, and not immigrants; and the remark is
generally applicable. The etymology of the words used
by the Greeks and Romans, to designate the aboriginal
races, supports the conjecture of their identity; for, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
already shown<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>, the term &ldquo;giant&rdquo; (&#947;&#943;&#947;&#945;&#962;) is not descriptive
of extraordinary strength, but, equally with the phrases
<i>autocthonoi</i>, <i>terrigen&aelig;</i>, and <i>aborigines</i>, signifies &ldquo;the earth-born,&rdquo;
the natives of the soil.</p>

<p>Further than this we cannot here pursue the inquiry.
In a work of this description, it would be idle to speculate
on the means by which aboriginal races, as well as a
peculiar fauna and flora, were planted in distant lands,
whether islands or remote continents, on which they have
been found established by colonists and navigators, from
the earliest to the latest times. Ethnologists have laboured
to solve the difficulties surrounding the subject; with what
success, those who have studied their works must decide
for themselves.</p>

<p>The Sardinian Nuraghe are probably among the oldest
structures in the world, and may therefore be reasonably
considered the works of an aboriginal race; but their
origin, and that of the founders, are equally involved in
impenetrable mystery. Their rude, but massive and
shapely, cones have survived the ruin of the sumptuous
edifices of Babylon and Nineveh, of Ecbatana and Susa,
of Tyre and the Egyptian Thebes. Like the pyramids of
Egypt, they have witnessed, from their hoary tops, the
current of untold centuries rolling onwards, wave after
wave, in its turbid course. They have marked the rise and
the fall of empires, the vicissitudes of fortune, the illusory
hopes, the vain fears, and the insatiable desires of successive
generations of men, whose brief span of existence has
been that of a moment compared with the centuries that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
have looked down from their summits. But unlike the
Pyramids, whose mysteries are partially unveiled, they
give no note by which their age or their history may be
discovered. Mute on their solitary mounds, they give no
answer to the inquiries of the traveller or the learned,
when questioned,&mdash;what people of Herculean strength and
undaunted will reared their massive walls, wrought the
dark cells under the cover of their domes, and raised the
ponderous slab which crowns the cone? No image of
man, no form of beast, neither symbol nor inscription, are
sculptured or graven on the solid blocks, within or without,
to tell their tale. Well, then, may the thoughtful
traveller, contemplating with silent wonder these mysterious
cones, soliloquise in some such sort as this:&mdash;&ldquo;Surely
these structures must have been raised before men
had learned the arts of writing and engraving, for how
many thousands of the Nuraghe were built, in successive
periods, without their founders having acquired the faculty
of inscribing on them the name of a god or a hero, for a
memorial to future generations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The high road between Sassari and Cagliari, called the
<i>Strada Reale</i>, runs through the great level of the Campidano
for a distance of 140 miles, and as there is a daily
communication between the two cities by the well-appointed
<i>diligences</i> already mentioned, the journey, unlike others
in Sardinia, is performed with comfort and rapidity. But,
whatever he may gain by the exchange, the traveller will
hardly bid adieu to the mountains and forest-paths of the
Gallura and Barbagia without regret.</p>

<p>About half way, stands Oristano, an old city, of some
6000 inhabitants, with some of the Spanish character of
Alghero. Though fallen from its former importance, the
place is still wealthy, and, in some degree, commercial. It
is, however, deserted in the summer and autumn, when the
atmosphere becomes so pestilential from the inhalations of
the neighbouring stagna and lagunes as to justify the proverb:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A Oristano che ghe v&ugrave;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Oristano ghe resta!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The most striking object in the place is the belfry of the
cathedral, a detached octangular tower, roofed with a pear-shaped
dome, of coloured tiles, and commanding from the
summit a fine view of the plains from the sea to the distant
mountains. The orange groves of Milis, a village
lying a little out of the high road to Oristano, are worth a
visit. The trees are considered the finest in Europe. I
have never seen orange trees that will bear comparison with
them in any part of the world, except on some of the Dutch
farms in the Cape colony, where they are still more magnificent;
vying in size with the European oaks, planted,
probably at the same time, by the German settlers from
the Black Forest, the disbanded soldiers of the States of
Holland, to whom many of the African Boers owe their
origin. Such orange groves, when loaded with blossoms
and fruit, glowing in the shade of their dense masses of
glossy deep-green foliage, are perhaps the most charming
of vegetable productions. No idea of their richness and
beauty can be formed from the dwarf, round-topped trees,
one sees in most orange districts. Here, as in South Africa,
they owe their luxuriance to abundant irrigation. Some
of the trees at Milis are from thirty-five to forty feet
high, and there are said to be 300,000 of them of full
growth. The annual produce is estimated at from fifty to
sixty millions of fruit, and, being in great repute for their
quality, they are conveyed to Sassari and Cagliari, and all
parts of the island, the price varying from 1-1/2<i>d.</i> to 4-3/4<i>d.</i>
per dozen, according to circumstances.</p>

<p>Cagliari, the capital of Sardinia, a city containing upwards
of 35,000 inhabitants, is seen to most advantage
when approached from the sea, the campagna in the
vicinity being neither fertile nor picturesque. Standing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
the head of a noble bay or gulf, twenty-four miles in depth
and twelve across, with good anchorage everywhere, its
advantageous position pointed out Cagliari as a seat of
commerce from the earliest times. The Ph&#339;nicians, the
Greeks, and Carthaginians were attracted by the fine harbour,
and the inducements offered by the neighbouring
heights for the construction of a fortified town. The
Romans made it the chief seat of their rule in the island.
The port, called the Darsena, is capable of containing
more than all the shipping at present frequenting it, with
such a depth of water that, while I was at Cagliari, one of
the largest steamships in the royal Sardinian navy lay
alongside the quay.</p>

<p>In the view from the gulf, the eye first rests on the
upper town, surrounded with walls and towers, and
crowning the summit of a hill upwards of 400 feet above
the level of the sea. At the base of the heights lie
the suburbs of the Marina, Stampace, and Villanova, the
former occupying the space between the Castello, or Casteddu,
as the whole circuit of the fortified town is called,
and the port; and, with the two other suburbs, on the
east and west of the Marina, forming one long continuous
line of irregular buildings. In our <i>tableau</i>, the Casteddu
towers proudly over the lower town, which has grown
up beneath it since the Middle Ages. It still retains
its original importance, containing all the principal public
buildings, and being the residence of the government
officials, and, in short, the aristocratic quarter. The best
houses in the Marina are occupied by the foreign consuls
and persons engaged in commerce, so that there is a
marked distinction between the upper and lower parts of
the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides a strong citadel, there are, in the circuit of the
fortifications three massive towers, called the Elephant,
the Lion, and the Eagle, built by the Pisans; and the
Castello is entered by four arched and embattled gateways.
One of these was in the act of being demolished
during my recent visit to Cagliari, in order to afford freer
communication between the upper town and the Marina.
Its removal seemed emblematic of an improving state of
society, tending to level the barriers of caste, and engage
the rising generation of the privileged orders in pursuits
calculated as much for their own benefit as the development
of the resources with which Sardinia abounds.</p>

<p>Easy access to the Casteddu is gained by a circuitous
avenue cut on the sloping side of the hill and under the
escarped heights. Being planted with trees, it forms a
pleasant walk, commanding extensive views of the Campidano,
the distant mountains, and the Gulf of Cagliari.
The direct ascent from the Marina is steep and toilsome,
it being gained by a series of narrow avenues and flights
of steps, landing in streets running parallel with that side
of the Castello. These also are narrow as well as lofty,
like those of most fortified places in the south of Europe.
Here we find the best shops; and the thoroughfares have
a busy appearance, except in the heat of the day, when
most of the inhabitants indulge in the <i>siesta</i>.</p>

<p>The cathedral, standing in the heart of the Castello, was
built by the Pisans with part of the remains of a basilica
founded by Constantine. It is on a grand scale, having
three naves, and a presbytery ascended by several ranges of
steps. The church is embellished with fine marbles, and
the ornaments being rich, with some good pictures and
grand monuments, the effect, on the whole, is striking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
A crypt hewn out of the solid rock, under the presbytery, is
regarded with great reverence by the Sardes, as containing
the supposed remains of two hundred martyrs removed
there from the church of St. Saturninus, in 1617.</p>

<p>Among the fifty-two churches in the Castello and the
suburbs, I will only mention that of St. Augustine, attached
to which is the oratory built by himself during a short
visit to the island. A story is told of one of the beams for
the roof proving too short; upon which the saint, quoting
to the workmen the text declaring that to those who have
faith all things are possible, ordered them to pull at one
end while he took the other, when, scarcely touching it, the
beam stretched to the required length. St. Augustine's
remains were transported here in 505, from Hippo-Regius,
where he died, by the Catholic bishops exiled from Africa
by Thrasamond, king of the Vandals.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The Chronicles
inform us that these bishops, two hundred and twenty in
number, were sustained by the benevolence of Pope Symmachus,
a native of Sardinia, who sent them every year
money and clothes. St. Augustine's relics remained at
Cagliari till 722, when Luitprand, king of the Lombards,
in consequence of the danger to which they were constantly
exposed by the invasions of the Saracens, obtained them
from the Cagliarese, and carrying them to Pavia deposited
them in the duomo of that city, where they rested, till in
1842, these were restored to Hippo by the French.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The church of the Jesuits, at Cagliari, is described as
distinguished among the others for the sumptuousness of
its style, and its decorations of coloured marbles and
columns. It was closed, with the adjoining college, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
the time of my visit. The Jesuits formerly possessed
large estates, and had colleges in several of the principal
towns of the island. The whole were suppressed long ago;
but in 1823, the late king, Carlo Felice, partially restored
and re-endowed the order, some of the monks being re-established
in the college of Cagliari. Of late years, there
seems to have been a considerable reaction in the temper
of the Sardes as regards religion, at least, in the towns.
No people were more bigoted, more priest-ridden, more
credulous of the absurdest superstitions. But in a conversation
I recently had on the subject with a very intelligent
and well-informed friend in the island, he assured me that
the utmost laxity now prevails in the religious sentiments
of the people. They have lost all respect for the clergy,
calling them <i>bott&eacute;gaie</i>, shopkeepers, as mindful only of
the gains of their trade; and the churches <i>bott&eacute;ge</i>, shops.
There is no vitality in the religion of the people, the services
are a mere mummery, and the system is held together
principally by the attractions of the popular <i>festas</i>,
such as those described in a former chapter as scenes of
bacchanalian revelry tricked out in the paraphernalia of
religion. As for the Jesuits, the most obnoxious of the
ecclesiastics, my friend stated, that the populace of Cagliari
&ldquo;burnt them out,&rdquo; intending, I apprehend, to convey that
they were violently expelled.</p>

<p>In earlier visits to the Continent, and reflecting on the
subject at home, the question had often occurred whether,
with advancing intelligence, and growing aspirations for
civil and religious liberty, the people of Catholic countries
might not be drawn, in the course of events, to a
movement similar to that of our own Reformation of the
Church in the 16th century; the ruling powers, as then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
taking the lead, and emancipating their States from the
papal yoke. Thus, while abuses and gross doctrinal errors
were reformed, the exterior frame of the establishment, its
hierarchy, ceremonial, privileges and property would remain
intact; the whole system being so arranged as to be
brought into harmony with the action of government,
and to meet the demands of an enlightened age. Why
should there not be more reformed national and independent
churches?</p>

<p>In this view, when conversing with foreigners of intelligence,
I have often pointed out the distinction between
the Anglican Church and the &ldquo;Evangelical&rdquo; and other
Protestant communities abroad. Such a reform would
seem to be well suited to answer the wants of the kingdom
of Sardinia in the present state of her relations with the
Court of Rome. It would consolidate the fabric of the
constitutional government; and we may conceive that the
cabinet of Turin, and perhaps the king, are enlightened
enough to be sensible of its advantages.</p>

<p>But it may well be doubted whether the masses of the
population, in either that or any other Catholic country,
are ripe for such a revolution. In this age of reason, the
dogmas which formed the war-cries of Luther and Calvin
have lost their influence on the minds of men, and, except
in some sections of the various religious communities, a
general apathy on doctrinal subjects has succeeded the excitement
with which the Reformation was ushered in.
The tendency of the present age is in the direction of more
sweeping reforms, and when the time comes, as no
thoughtful man can doubt it will with growing intelligence,
for the people of Europe to cast off the shackles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
superstition and bigotry, it may be feared that things of
more serious account than ecclesiastical systems and institutions
may be swept away by the overwhelming tide so
long pent up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there appears little probability of any great
change. The territorial distinctions between Catholic and
Protestant States remain much the same as when they
were shaped out in the time of the Reformation, and the
wars succeeding it. Each party holds its own; and there
is little probability of a national secession from the
Church of Rome, even in the Sardinian dominions, where
many circumstances concur to point out its expediency,
and even its possibility. Among others, it will not be
forgotten, that the standard of Protestantism was raised in
the valleys of Savoy, ages before it floated triumphantly
in the north of Europe.</p>

<p>In 1841 there were 91 monasteries in Sardinia, containing
1093 regular monks, besides lay brothers, &amp;c., and
16 convents with 260 nuns; the whole number of persons
attached to these institutions being calculated at 8000.
There are about the same number of secular clergy, including
the bishops, dignitaries, and cathedral chapters,
with the parochial clergy, the island being divided into
393 parishes. The population of Sardinia, by the last
returns I was able to procure<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>, was 541,907 in 1850; so
that one-ninth were ecclesiastics of one description or
another. It should be stated, however, that most, if not
all, the monasteries and convents have been lately suppressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
and the religious pensioned off, so that the system
is dying out.</p>

<p>The revenues of the bishops' sees, and the cathedral
and parochial clergy, were calculated in 1841 at about
66,000<i>l.</i>, arising from church lands, besides the tithes,
estimated at 1,500,000 lire nove, or 60,000<i>l.</i>, supposed to
be a low estimate, the tithes being worth one million of
lire more. These revenues are exclusive of voluntary
contributions, alms, offerings, and collections. The church
lands contributed upwards of 3000<i>l.</i> annually as state
subsidies, for the national debt, the maintaining roads and
bridges, and the conveyance of the post. Mr. Tyndale estimates
&ldquo;the revenue of the see of Cagliari at from 60,000
to 80,000 scudi,&mdash;from 11,520<i>l.</i> to 15,360<i>l.</i> per annum;
while that of the priests is about 1000 scudi, or 192<i>l.</i>&rdquo; This
gives some idea of the incomes of the Sardinian clergy. I
imagine that the government has not interfered with any
part of the ecclesiastical revenues, except those attached
to the monasteries.</p>

<p>The fruit and vegetable markets of large foreign towns
must always be attractive to a traveller, especially in the
South and East, where the fruit, in great varieties, is so
abundant, and he meets with vegetables unknown in the
gardens and cookery of his own country. Not only so, but
the dresses, and even the gestures and manners, of the
country people, to say nothing of the dealings of the buyers,
form a never-failing source of interest and amusement;
while an additional zest is lent in a warm climate, by the
freshness of the early hour at which the visit must be paid
to be really enjoyed. The market at Cagliari is held in the
suburb of Stampace, and approached by one of those avenues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
shaded with exotic trees, which make such agreeable promenades
in the neighbourhood of the city. The principal
supply comes from Pula, Arabus, and other villages at considerable
distances from Cagliari; the soil in the vicinity being
too arid to be productive. The supply appeared abundant,
and of excellent quality. Among the fruits,&mdash;it was in
the early part of September,&mdash;I noted grapes, figs, pears,
oranges, lemons, citrons, peaches, melons, and prickly
pears. Among the vegetables, the heaps of tomatas, chilis,
and other condiments were surprising, and there were
gigantic &ldquo;<i>torzi</i>,&rdquo; a kind of turnip-cabbage, and other
varieties, whose names have escaped my memory.</p>

<p>My visit to the Royal Museum was also paid at an early
hour, through the kindness of Signor Cara, the Curator,
who was so obliging as to show me also his cabinet of antiques
at his private residence,&mdash;rich in cameos, intaglios,
and scarabei of rare beauty. The Royal Museum occupies
a suite of small apartments in the University. The collection
owes great part of its objects of interest, and their
good order and arrangement, to the indefatigable zeal
and disinterested devotion of Signor Cara, whose appointments,
and the allowance for purchasing objects, are not
unworthy of a liberal government.</p>

<p>The collection of Roman antiquities occupying the entrance-wall
is very meagre, considering the many stations
established in the island during the republic and empire.
Besides two colossal consular statues, having an air of
dignity, and with the toga well chiselled, there was little to
observe but some Roman milestones, sarcophagi, and
fragments of various kinds.</p>

<p>The coins of the Roman period are numerous, but most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
of them of little value. One here figured is, however,
unique; being, I
imagine, the only
coin known to have
been struck in the
island. Atius Balbus,
whose name and bust
appear on the face<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>,
was grandfather of
the Emperor Augustus, and prefect of Sardinia about sixty
years before Christ. The reverse represents a head wearing
a singular cap, crowned by an ostrich plume; with a
sceptre, and the words &ldquo;Sardus Pater,&rdquo; who is supposed
to be the founder of Nora, the first town built in Sardinia,
and of Libyan and Ph&#339;nician origin.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

title="CARTHAGINIAN COIN." />
<p class="caption">CARTHAGINIAN COIN.</p>
</div>

<p>The cabinet also contains about 100 coins of the Carthaginian
period. Many such are found in the island,
but, as may be supposed, not in numbers equal to those
which attest the long duration of the Roman power.
While Captain Smyth was engaged in his survey of the
coast, a farmer in the island of St. Pietro, successively a
Greek, Carthaginian, and Roman station, passed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
ploughshare over an amphora of Carthaginian brass coins,
of which Captain Smyth purchased about 250. &ldquo;They
were,&rdquo; he states, &ldquo;with two exceptions, of the usual type:
obverse, the head of Ceres; and reverse, a horse or palm-tree,
or both.&rdquo; Some presented to
me by Carlo Rugiu, one of
which is here figured, have a
horse's head on one face, and
the palm-tree with fruit, probably
dates, on the other.</p>

<p>There are specimens in the British Museum, but not so
good as those given me by Signor Rugiu. The coins in
the possession of Captain Smyth appear to have represented
the horse in full detail, as he mentions the peculiarity
of their having a Punic character between the
horse's legs, differing in every one. It need hardly be
observed how appropriate, on an African coin, were such
devices as the date-palm of the desert, and the horse, emblematic
of its fiery cavalry.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/418b.jpg" width="250" height="130" alt="SARACEN COIN."

<p class="caption">SARACEN COIN.</p>

<p>Some Saracenic coins are also found in the island, with
Arabic characters both on the obverse and reverse. The
one here represented was also
given me by Carlo Rugiu,
with some Roman coins, both
silver and brass. We do not
find that the Saracens ever
effected any permanent settlement
in Sardinia; which accounts
for the comparatively
small number of these coins discovered. The Saracen
pirates who infested the coast from the time that St. Augustine's
relics were rescued, in 722, to so late a period as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
1815, were more likely to pillage the money of the inhabitants
than to leave any of their own behind them.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>The Terracotta collection in the Royal Museum exhibits
about one thousand specimens of vases, &amp;c. of Sardo-Ph&#339;nician,
Carthaginian, Egyptian, and Roman fabric,
similar to those preserved in the British Museum. In the
natural-history department, the ornithological class is most
complete, containing upwards of a thousand specimens of
native and foreign birds, collected and prepared by Signor
Cara, who has paid much attention to this branch of the
science. Among the native objects of interest was the
flamingo, frequenting, with other aquatic birds, in vast
flocks, the lagunes in the neighbourhood of Cagliari,
whither they resort during the autumn and winter, from
the coast of Africa. The largest of these lakes, called the
Scaffa, is six or seven miles long by three or four broad.
Vast quantities of salt are procured from the salterns in
the same neighbourhood and other parts of Sardinia, and
it forms an important article of export, and of revenue.
In conchology and mineralogy, the cabinet is rich both in
foreign and native specimens; the minerals having been
in great part collected by La Marmora, and arranged by
him in 1835.</p>

<p>The Ph&#339;nician remains are, in some respects, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
interesting part of the collection. Among them we find
a block of sandstone, with a Ph&#339;nician inscription, discovered
in 1774 at Pula, the ancient Nora, now a pleasant
village embowered in orange groves and orchards, and
crowned with palms, on the coast of the Gulf, about sixteen
miles from Cagliari. Nora, it may be remembered, is
stated by Greek writers to have been the first town founded
by colonists in the island of Sardinia; and though the
inscription on the stone has not been satisfactorily deciphered,
it seems to be agreed that it records the arrival
of &ldquo;Sardus,&rdquo; called &ldquo;Pater,&rdquo; at &ldquo;Nora,&rdquo; from &ldquo;Tarshish,&rdquo;
in Libya.</p>

<p>But the Sarde idols, already mentioned, form the unique
feature in this collection. La Marmora enumerates 180
of these bronzes, the greater part of which are preserved
in the museum at Cagliari, consisting principally of small
images, varying from four to seventeen inches high, of
irregular and often grotesque forms, and betraying a rude
state of art.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> They are considered miniatures of the
large and original idols adored by the Canaanites and
Syro-Ph&#339;nicians; and from their diminutive size may
have been household gods. Mr. Tyndale conjectures that
the &ldquo;Teraphim&rdquo; of Scripture were of the same class.
There appears, however, no doubt that these bronzes, as
well as the objects in Terracotta already mentioned, are of
native manufacture. Thus, while the images appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
be the symbols of a religion peculiar to the inhabitants
of Sardinia at a very early period, they bear a certain
affinity to similar objects of worship in other countries,
especially in Syria and Egypt; so that in Signor Cara's
nomenclature these remains are denominated Sardo-Ph&#339;nician
and Sardo-Egyptian. It is remarkable, however,
that no corresponding relics have been found in those
countries.</p>

<p>There is a small collection of Sardinian antiquities in
the British Museum, recently supplied by Signor Cara;
but it does not contain, as might have been wished, any
specimens of these singular images. They are accurately
figured and described by La Marmora, and Mr. Tyndale
has fully investigated their history and relations in his
very valuable work. It would be out of place further to
pursue the subject here, especially as we have already
devoted a chapter to traces among the Sardes of the rites of
Moloch and Adonis, in which two of these images are described.
The subject is interesting both as connected with
the Ph&#339;nician migrations, and as bringing to light symbols
of that Canaanitish idolatry so frequently and emphatically
denounced in the Sacred Writings.</p>

<p>Returning to modern times, I do not find that I have
anything of importance to add to my notices of the present
state of Cagliari, except the introduction of the Electric
Telegraph connecting it with the continents of Europe and
Africa. Prom its having been the medium of communication
between England and India during the recent
crisis, Cagliari has acquired a notoriety to which it had
previously few pretensions. Some account of the establishment
of this Telegraph will be given in our concluding
chapters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Porto-Torres.&mdash;Another Italian Refugee.&mdash;Embark for
Genoa.&mdash;West Coast of Corsica.&mdash;Turin.&mdash;The Sardinian
Electric Telegraph.&mdash;The Wires laid to Cagliari</i>.</p>


<p>The preceding notices of Cagliari were gathered during a
visit to Sardinia in the autumn of 1867; the &ldquo;Rambles&rdquo;
in this island, detailed in preceding chapters, having been
rather abruptly terminated, under circumstances already
adverted to, without our being able to reach the capital.
On that occasion we embarked for the continent at Porto-Torres,
the origin and decay of which place is before incidentally
mentioned. The neighbourhood abounds in
remains of Roman antiquities; and at a short distance is
the cathedral of St. Gavino, one of the oldest structures in
Sardinia, having been founded in the eleventh century.
The roof is covered with lead, and supported by antique
columns dug up in the adjacent ruins. There also were
found two marble sarcophagi, preserved in the church, on
which figures of Apollo surrounded by the Muses are represented
in high relief.</p>

<p>Having to embark at an early hour, we were obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
pass a night at Porto-Torres, notwithstanding its notoriety
for a most pestiferous atmosphere, occasioned, as usual,
by the exhalations from the marshy lowlands adjoining
the coast. The impression was confirmed by the miserable
aspect of the place, one long wide vacant street, in which,
as we drove down it, the effects of the intemperie were
stamped on the sickly faces of the few stragglers we met.
We found, however, a roomy and decent hotel, and, after
rambling about the neighbourhood, sat down to our usual
evening tasks of writing and drawing. We were in light
costume, and had thrown open the casements, for though
the apartment was both lofty and spacious, the air felt
insufferably close and stifling. Shortly afterwards, on the
waiter coming in to lay the supper table, he stood aghast
at our exposure to the night air, and precipitately dosed
the casements, exclaiming, &ldquo;Signore, it would have been
death for you to have slept here in August or September;
and, even now, the risk you are running is not
slight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This man was another of the Italian refugees, a
Lombard; but of a very superior cast of character and
intelligence to our <i>ma&icirc;tre de cuisine</i> at Sassari. These
qualities first opened out on his begging permission to
examine my friend's drawings and some ancient coins
which lay on the table; on both which he made remarks,
showing that he was a person of education and taste. He
had been an <i>avocat</i> at Milan, and, compromised by the
insurrection, &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what I have been
driven to,&rdquo; throwing a napkin, over his shoulder with
somewhat of a theatrical air. &ldquo;But a good time is coming;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
meanwhile, not having much to do here, I employ my time
as well as I can. You shall see my little library;&rdquo;&mdash;and
he brought in some volumes, mostly classical, the
Odyssey, Euripides, Sophocles, &AElig;schylus, and Cornelius
Nepos. After awhile he pulled out of his bosom,
with some mystery, for he was still professedly a
catholic, a small copy of Diodati's Italian version of the
New Testament. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, with emphasis, &ldquo;is my
greatest consolation; I retire into the fields, and there I
read it.&rdquo; It was impossible not to commiserate the fate
of Ignazio Mugio, the Lombard refugee. A very different
character was old Pietro, the steam-boat agent. Groping
our way with some difficulty up a gloomy staircase, in the
dusk of the evening, we found him, spectacles on nose,
poring over a gazette by a feeble oil lamp. The old man
was so eager for news that it was difficult to fix him to
the object of our inquiries; and then he expatiated on the
attractions of the neighbourhood, and the &ldquo;chasse magnifique
de gr&egrave;ves,&rdquo; as he called thrush-shooting, in the
country round, if we came to Porto-Torres in the month
of December. We laughed at the idea of such sport; but
I think it is said that the thrushes, fattening on the olive
berries, are very delicious.</p>

<p>A considerable commerce, considerable for a Sardinian
port, gives some life to this desolate place; facilitated by
Porto-Torres being the northern terminus of the great
national road running through Sassari, only nine miles
distant. The principal exports are oil and wine. The
little haven is defended by a strong tower, erected in
1549. We found moored in the port several Greek
brigs, polaccas, and feluccas, with their long yards and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
pointed lateen sails; and the fine steam-boat which was to
carry us to Genoa.</p>

<p>The mountainous and nearly desert island of Asinara
forms a fine object in running out of the gulf to which it
gives its name, forming the north-western point; and the
high lands of Corsica soon came once more in view. Our
course lay along its western coast, the weather being
favourable; but with a foul wind it is considered unsafe,
and vessels run through the Straits of Bonifacio and coast
the eastern side of the island. In the afternoon we were
off the entrance of the Gulf of Ajaccio, and gazed from
seaward on the Isles Sanguinaires, with the tower of the
lighthouse, behind which the sun set on the pleasant
evening when we took our view from the Chapel of the
Greeks. Now, towards sunset, we were rapidly gliding
along the shore of Isola Rossa, and the slanting rays
glowing directly on the porphyritic cliffs gave a rich but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
mellow intensity to the ruddy hue whence they derive
their name. Some of the boats stop at the town, a new
erection by Pascal Paoli, and the seat of an increasing
trade. Leaving it behind, we ran along the coast of
Corsica with a fair wind, exultingly bounding homewards
as, the breeze freshening, our boat sprung from wave to
wave, dashing the spray from her bows. Farewell to
Corsica! Her grey peaks and shaggy hill-sides are fast
fading from our sight, in the growing obscurity. We pass
Calvi, famous in Medi&aelig;val and Nelsonian annals, San
Fiorenzo, on which we had looked down in our rambles on
the chestnut-clad ridges of the Nebbio; and the mountain
masses of the Capo-Corso, now loom like dark clouds on
the eastern horizon. All beyond is a blank. Again we
cross the Tuscan Sea in the depth of the night. We are
on deck when rosy morning opens to our view the glories
of the Bay of Genoa. At six we are moored in the harbour,
and have to wait for the visit of the officer of health. At
last we land, breakfast, and take the rail to Turin.</p>

<p>At Turin we passed some hours very pleasantly at the
British Minister's. We are indebted to Sir James Hudson
for facilitating our excursion in Sardinia with more than
official zeal and interest in its success. He knows the
island well, having braved the inconveniences of rough
travelling in its wildest districts. At his hotel we chanced
to meet Mr. I. W. Brett, the promoter of a line of electric
telegraph intended to connect the islands of Corsica and
Sardinia with the European and African continents. A
company had been formed to carry out this project, consisting
principally of Italian shareholders, part of whose
outlay was to be recouped, on the completion of the
undertaking, by the Governments interested in its success&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
French in regard to Corsica and Algeria, and the
Piedmontese as far as concerns Sardinia.</p>

<p>Starting from a point in the Gulf of Spezzia, the wires
were to be carried by a submarine cable to the northern
extremity of Capo-Corso; where landing they would be
conveyed, through the island, partly by submarine channels,
with a branch to Ajaccio, to its southern point near
Bonifacio. Thence, submerged in a cable crossing the
Straits, they would again touch the land at Capo Falcone,
mentioned in these rambles as the nearest point in Sardinia;
the distance being only about ten nautical miles.
The wires were then to be conducted on posts, through the
island of Sardinia, in a line, varying but slightly from our
route, by Tempio and Sassari to Cagliari. From Cape
Spartivento, or some point on the southern shore of Sardinia,
a submarine cable was to be laid, the most arduous
part of the whole undertaking, to the African coast;
landing somewhere near Bona, a town on the western
frontier of the French possessions in Algeria.</p>

<p>Up to the point of the landing in Sardinia all was
evidently plain sailing; but when we met Mr. Brett at
Turin, on our return from Sardinia, in November, 1853,
he was under some anxiety about the land line through
the island; the mountainous character of the northern
province of Gallura presenting obstacles to the operation
of carrying the wires through it, and the lawless
character of the inhabitants threatening their safety. On
both these points we were able to reassure him; we had
seen and heard enough of the brave mountaineers to feel
convinced that there was no cause for apprehension of
outrages connected with the undertaking. And my fellow-traveller,
who belonged to the scientific branch of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
army, had not passed through the country without making
such observations as enabled him to satisfy Mr. Brett's
inquiries respecting the line to be selected and its natural
facilities.</p>

<p>In the end, the wires were successfully stretched throughout
the island from Capo Falcone to Cagliari, after surmounting,
however, serious obstacles, though not of the
sort previously apprehended. For the success of this operation
the company are greatly indebted to the exertions
of Mr. William S. Craig, H.B.M.'s Consul-General in Sardinia.
Having neither any personal interest in the concern,
nor official connection with a Company entirely foreign in
its object and supporters, he devoted his time gratuitously
to the furtherance of this branch of its operations, actuated
only by a desire to promote an important public undertaking.
The whole practical management of the work (I do
not speak of engineering, little of which could be required)
devolved on Mr. Craig; and with much self-sacrifice, he
threw into it all that zeal and intelligence which, with
universal goodwill, have acquired for him the high estimation
in which he is generally held.</p>

<p>I have before had occasion to mention the respect entertained
for him by the mountaineers of Gallura, resulting
from a former connection beneficial to parts of that district;
and I feel convinced that his name and sanction better
obviated any prejudices, and offered a broader shield for the
protection of the wires from injury, than all the power of
the Piedmontese officials, backed by squadrons of carabineers,
could have done. Not only so, but Mr. Craig
had less difficulty in making arrangements with the proprietors
of the lands in the northern province than in the
more civilised districts of the south, where, in some instances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
the privileges required were reluctantly conceded
as a mark of personal respect.</p>

<p>It was on descending to the plains that the worst difficulties
were encountered. Mr. Warre Tyndale states that
during the construction of the great central road from
Cagliari to Porto-Torres, which it took seven years to complete,
more than half the engineers employed in the work
died of the intemperie, or were obliged to retire from the
effects of that fatal malady. This scourge swept off with
no less virulence the workmen employed on the line of
telegraph, and as the season advanced, cartloads after cartloads
were carried to the hospitals, so that the works were
stopped. Mr. Craig had to provide for all emergencies,
the whole expenditure was managed by him, and this
calamity added to his cares and responsibilities. But he
persevered, and brought the operations to a successful end.
Such valuable services merited a more liberal treatment
than they received at the hands of those who gratuitously
secured them. A body of English directors and shareholders
would not have failed to mark their sense of the
obligation conferred by some honorary acknowledgment.
I have not heard of any such act of generosity on the part
of the Sardo-French Company. It was a foreigner who
remarked to me the <i>petitesses</i> which pervaded the dealings
of his countrymen. I imagine that the phrase would
be found particularly applicable to the dealings of this
company, if all its history were known.</p>

<p>But we are anticipating occurrences. On our return
from Sardinia, the operations of the Sardo-French Telegraph
Company connected with the island were yet in
embryo. The travellers who discussed the probabilities
of success at Turin little thought that one of them would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
two years afterwards, towards the close of the Crimean
war, be the Chief of the Staff employed in the organisation
and superintendence of the military telegraph service in
the East, having to inspect the laying down many hundred
miles of submarine cable and wires in the Black Sea; or
that it would be the fortune of the other to witness the final
accomplishment of the long-delayed and frustrated hopes
of the Sardo-French Company, by being present at the
laying down of the submarine Mediterranean cable between
Cagliari and Bona on the coast of Algeria. But so
it turned out; and the completion of this undertaking
being an event in Sardinian history, considered by no less
an authority than General Della Marmora to have an
important bearing on the commercial prospects of the
island,&mdash;and the operation of successfully submerging telegraph
cables in very deep water, in oceans or seas, being
both new and possessing considerable interest,&mdash;a short
account by an eyewitness of the occurrences attending the
laying down the African cable may prove both amusing
and instructive. It will form an appropriate episode to
the Sardinian Rambles, and in that view an additional
chapter will be devoted to it.</p>

<p>For the rest, it only remains briefly to close the
&ldquo;Rambles&rdquo; of 1853. Our visit at Turin reopened
Sardinian interests; but after that, the best thing to be
done was to hasten homewards before the inclemency of
the season should retard our progress. Still, the snow fell
heavily as we walked over the summit of the pass of the
Mont-Cenis, preceding the diligence in which we had
travelled all night. The railway had not then been extended
from Turin to Suza on one side of the Alps, nor,
on the other, beyond Ch&acirc;lons sur Sa&ocirc;ne, between Lyons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
and Paris; so that, travelling by diligence, we were three
nights and two days on the road to Paris. Both the French
and Italian lines of railway have been much advanced
since the period of our journey. To complete the line, it
remains only that the gigantic undertaking of tunnelling
the chain of the Alps be successfully executed. Allowing
ourselves the refreshment of spending a day in Paris, we
reached London in the evening of the 17th of November.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

Coast.&mdash;The Cable laid.&mdash;Cagliari an Important Telegraph
Station.&mdash;Its Commerce.&mdash;The return Voyage.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span></i></p>


<p>After completing the land line of telegraph, as already
mentioned, the Sardinian Company<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> failed in three attempts
at laying a submarine cable to connect the wires
from Cagliari with the coast of Algeria. We will not here
enter into an inquiry as to the causes of these disasters,
instructive as it might be if we had space, and this were
a fitting opportunity. Suffice it to say that the first
experiment failed soon after leaving Cape Spartivento; on
the second, the line was laid for about two-thirds of the
course, but with such a profuse expenditure of the submarine
cable that it was run out, and the enterprise
abruptly terminated. A third attempt to renew the operation
proved equally unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The project received a severe check from these repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
failures. The company had established their line, by sea
and land, as far as Cagliari. So far, well: the communications
of the respective Governments with their islands of
Corsica and Sardinia were complete. Incidentally, also,
England derived some advantage from the stations at
Cagliari during the most anxious period of the crisis in Indian
affairs. It was one step in advance towards telegraphic
communications with India, though a short one. But the
main object of the French Government in promoting the
enterprise was to link its connection with Algeria by the
electric wires; and till that was accomplished, the Company
had no claim to be reimbursed for that portion of their
expenditure guaranteed in the event of success.</p>

<p>One may imagine the dismay of the shareholders, mostly
Italians, in this state of affairs. Their capital must have
been greatly, if not altogether, exhausted by the expenditure
on previous works and the abortive attempts at laying
the African cable. It was now only, in all probability,
that they became seriously alive to the difficulties of the
undertaking, and the immense risks that must be incurred
in laying submarine cables in great depths of water. For
it was now known that the depth of the Mediterranean
in many parts crossed by the track of submarine cables, is
no less than that through which the Transatlantic cable
has to be laid.</p>

<p>The prosecution of the scheme was suspended; but meanwhile
time was running on, and the period fixed for completing
the line had nearly expired. In this event, the
government guarantee being forfeited, the concern would
become a ruinous affair, as the telegraph traffic of two small
islands could not be remunerative for the capital expended
in connecting them with the continent. A short extension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
of the term for completing the undertaking had been
obtained; but that was nearly run out before matters were
put in a better train.</p>

<p>In this emergency, Mr. Brett, the <i>g&eacute;rant</i> of the foreign
company, who had contracted for and personally superintended
the previous attempts to lay the African cable,
entered into negotiations for its being undertaken by
Messrs. Newall and Co. They had an established reputation,
not only as having long been manufacturers
of submarine electric cables, the quality of which had
been tested by continuous service, but as having, under
contracts with the English Government, laid down between
five and six hundred miles of cable in the Black
Sea during the Crimean war, without a single mishap.
They were, therefore, not mere theorists; having acquired
by long experience a practical knowledge of submarine
telegraphy which had not fallen to the lot of any others
who had turned their attention to that branch of the
science.</p>

<p>The overtures made on the part of the Sardo-French
Company having been favourably received in the course, I
believe, of the summer of 1857, Messrs. Newall and Co.,
nothing daunted by the previous failures, though doubtless
fully aware of the difficulties they had to encounter, agreed
to lay the African cable for a given sum, taking all risks
on themselves. When it is understood that, about the
same time, they also contracted with the &ldquo;Mediterranean
Extension Company,&rdquo; on like terms as to responsibility,
to lay down submarine cables between Cagliari and Malta,
and from Malta to Corfu, extending over 795 nautical
miles, and making, with the African cable, a total of
920 miles, some idea may be formed of the magnitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
the operations undertaken by a single firm. The mileage
is more than one third of the distance embraced in the
scheme of the great Transatlantic Company; and, as we
find that the Mediterranean has its deep hollows as well
as the Atlantic, the difficulties were proportionate.</p>

<p>Having entered into these engagements, Messrs. Newall
and Co., after completing their contract for one half, 1250
miles, of the Transatlantic cable, lost no time in proceeding
with the manufacture of the Mediterranean cables at their
works in Birkenhead. Towards the end of August, the
African cable, with some portion of the Malta cable, was
shipped in the Mersey aboard their steamship Elba,
the vessel before employed in laying down the cable between
Varna and Constantinople. It should be mentioned
that the African cable contained four wires, so that it was
more ponderous and less flexible than the Atlantic cable,
which has only one.</p>

<p>About this time, the writer happened to hear what was
going on. Being then engaged in preparing these Sardinian
&ldquo;Rambles&rdquo; for the press, he was desirous to
make another trip to the island before their publication;
and, besides the connection of the Cagliari line of telegraphs
with the objects of his work, other circumstances
had made him generally interested in the subject of submarine
telegraphy. He therefore requested Mr. R.S.
Newall's permission for his joining the expedition, which
was kindly granted.</p>

<p>With this preliminary statement, we proceed at once to
the scene of action. At the last moment it had been
decided, for reasons with which I am unacquainted, but,
I believe, on the suggestion of the foreign Governments
interested in the project, to start from the African coast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
instead of from Cagliari; Cape de Garde, a few miles eastward
of Bona, a town on the Tunisian frontier of the
French possessions in Algeria, being selected as the point
at or near which the submarine cable was to be submerged.
The Elba, with the cable on board, anchored off Bona
on Saturday, the 5th of September. Three war-steamships,
appointed by the foreign Governments to attend and assist
in the operations, had arrived some days before, and lay at
anchor in the haven of Cazerain. The little squadron consisted
of the Brandon, a large frigate under the French
flag, with the Monzambano and the Ichnusa, both belonging
to the royal Sardinian navy; and on board were
the Commissioners appointed by the respective Governments
to watch the operations.</p>

<p>It blew hard after the Elba's arrival, and the ships
being detained in harbour, waiting for a favourable wind,
opportunities offered of landing at Bona, and making some
excursions into the surrounding country. The old Arab
town rises from the sea in the form of an amphitheatre,
and you see its high embattled walls running up the hill-side
and embracing in its enceinte the citadel, or Casbah,
crowning the heights; the whole backed by the towering
summits and shaggy slopes of the chain of Mount Edough.
Within is a labyrinth of narrow streets; that leading direct
from the port crossing a steep ridge to the Place d'Armes,
a square with a fountain in the centre, overhung with
palms and other exotics, and where French architecture is
singularly mixed with the Moorish style. On one side
stands a mosque, with its tall minaret; on the other, range
caf&eacute;s and restaurants, and magazins de mode, with their
lofty fronts, arcades, and balconies. We linger for a
moment on the spectacle offered by the various populations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
which crowd the square from morn to eve, and most
after nightfall; a motley crowd of Arabs, Moors, Zouaves,
Chasseurs, Jews, and Maltese. In the picturesque contrast
of costume it presents, the gayest French uniforms
possess no attractions compared with the white and flowing
bournous, with even the sheepskin mantle of the poor
Arab of the desert, the bright braided caftan of the Moor,
the turban, and the fez. But the limits assigned to this
work being already exceeded, I may not allow myself to
dwell on the numberless objects which attract the attention
of a curious traveller, in scenes where the modes
and forms of Oriental life are singularly blended with
those that bear the freshest European stamp.</p>

<p>Nor is this the place for more than noting an excursion
to the picturesque ruins of Hippona, the old Roman city,
the Hippo-Regius, where the great St. Augustine laboured
in the African episcopate, and ended his days during the
sufferings of Genseric's siege. They stand on a hillock
facing the sea, now covered with thickets of wild olive
trees and fragments of the buildings. What a plain is
that you see from the summit, stretching away in all directions,
a vast expanse of grassy meadows on the banks
of the river Seybouse; parched indeed now by the torrid
heat of an African summer, but of rich verdure after the
rains! What prodigious ricks of hay we observe at the
French cavalry barracks, as we ride along! What growth
of vegetables in the irrigated gardens of the industrious,
but turbulent, Maltese! Surely, but for the French inaptitude
to colonisation, this part of Algeria, at least,
might be turned to good account.</p>

<p>Changing the scene for a moment from the sultry
plains, we may just note another excursion, which led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
to the summit of the pass crossing the chain of Mount
Edough. At the top we look westward over a sea of
mountains, towards and beyond Constantine, the strongholds
of the indomitable Kabyles. Turning homewards,
we slowly descend the winding road, among slopes covered
with a coarser <i>maquis</i>&mdash;still more fitted to endure the
drought&mdash;than the evergreen thickets of Corsica and Sardinia;
the dwarf palm, <i>cham&aelig;rops humilis</i>, most prevailing.
Bona, with its walls and terraces and the Casbah
and the minarets, rising above a grove of orchards and
gardens, now makes a pleasing picture. Beyond, in the
still water of the haven, our little fleet lies at anchor, with
the French guardship; outside, the blue Mediterranean is
now very gently rippled by the evening breeze.</p>

<p>We are recalled to the ships, and hasten on board, for
the wind having changed, with a promise of fair weather,
it is decided to commence operations. The point selected
for landing the shore-end of the cable was a sandy cove, a
little to the eastward of Cape de Garde, or as it is otherwise
called Cap Rouge, a literal translation of <i>Ras-el-Hamrah</i>,
the name given it by the natives. There is an
easy ascent from the cove to Fort G&eacute;nois, about half a
mile distant. The fort, a white square building at the
edge of the cliffs, said to have been built by the Genoese
to protect their coral fisheries on this coast, was convenient
for establishing a temporary telegraph station, wires being
run up to it from the end of the submarine cable.</p>

<p>It was a lovely morning, the sun bright in a cloudless
sky and the blue Mediterranean calm as a lake, when
the little squadron having got up steam, ran along the
shore, and successively anchored in the cove. There floated,
in happy union, the flags of the three allied Powers recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
engaged in very different operations: and the ships,
with their boats passing and repassing, formed a lively
scene contrasted with that desert shore, on the rocks of
which a solitary Arab stood watching proceedings so
strange to him.</p>

<p>The Elba's stern having been brought round to the
land, the ship was moored within cable's length of the
sandy beach; but the operation of landing the submarine
cable was delayed in consequence of the neglect of the
Sardinian company's agents, whose duty it was to have
the land-line of telegraph wires ready to communicate with
Port G&eacute;nois. This occupied the whole day, and I took
advantage of it, landing in one of the first boats, to make
a long ramble, visiting, in the course of it, Fort G&eacute;nois,
an encampment of Arabs at some distance in the interior,
and climbing to the lighthouse on Cape de Garde, commanding,
as may be imagined, magnificent views. It was
a toilsome march, over rocks and sands, and through
prickly thickets, in the full blaze of an African sun at
noontide; but the excursion was full of interest, and not
without its trifling adventures.</p>

<p>The shore works were not completed till sunset, when,
all the boats being recalled to the ships, they got under
weigh, the Monzambano towing the Elba, with the
Ichnusa ahead, and the Brandon on her larboard bow.
The engineers began paying out the cable at eight o'clock,
proceeding at first slowly, as the night was dark, and being
desirous to try cautiously the working of the machinery.
As the water deepened, the cable ran out fast, and the
speed was increased, so that by midnight we had run
about seventeen miles, with a loss in slack, it was reckoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
up to that time, of under twenty per cent, of cable, compared
with the distance run.</p>

<p>Few, I imagine, aboard the Elba got much sleep that
night. The very idea of sleep was precluded by the incessant
roar of the cable, rushing, like a mighty cataract,
through the iron channels confining its course over the
deck, while the measured strokes of the steam-engine beat
time to the roar. Having laid down for two hours, I gave
up my cabin to one of our numerous guests; for the French
and Italian commissioners being now on board the Elba,
besides Mr. Werner Siemens and his staff of German telegraphists,
her accommodations were fully tried; and as for
languages, she was a floating Babel. Coming on deck at
twelve o'clock, the lighthouse on Cape de Garde was still
visible. The attendant ships carried bright lanterns at
their mastheads, sometimes throwing up signal rockets;
and so the convoy swept steadily on through the darkness,
the Elba still following in the wake of the Monzambano.
Mr. Newall and Mr. C. Liddell, who directed the whole
operations, never quitted their post at the break. The
telegraphists, from their station amidship, tested the insulation
from time to time, speaking to the station at Port
G&eacute;nois. Looking down into the mainhold, which was
well lighted up, you saw the men cutting the lashings to
release the cable, as, gradually unfolding its serpentine
coils from the cone in the centre, it was dragged rapidly
upwards by the strain of its vast weight, and rushed
through the rings to the vessel's stern. There the speed
was moderated, before it plunged from the taffrail into
the depths beneath, by the slow revolutions of a large
wheel, round which the cable took several turns.</p>

<p>As day broke and the sun rose magnificently over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
Mediterranean, Galita Island came in sight, distant from
thirty to forty miles to the eastward; the high lands of
Africa being still visible. With the sea perfectly calm,
all augured well for the success of the enterprise, except
that serious apprehensions were entertained lest the cable,
paying out so fast in the great depth of water we were
now crossing,&mdash;1500 fathoms,&mdash;might not hold out to reach
the land. Thus we ran on all the morning, the vessel's
speed being increased to between five and six knots per
hour, and the strain on the cable to five tons per mile; the
depth ranging from 1500 to 1700 fathoms.</p>

<p>Towards the afternoon the land of Sardinia was in sight
between fifty and sixty miles ahead, our course being
steered towards Cape Teulada, the extreme southern point
of the island. By sunset we had reached within twelve
miles of the shore, and angles having been carefully taken
to fix our exact position, we anchored in eighty fathoms
water. Soon afterwards the attendant ships closed in, and
anchored near us for the night. The little squadron, well
lighted, formed a cheerful group, the sea was smooth as
a mill-pond, and the mountains of Sardinia, after reflecting
the last rays of the setting sun, loomed heavily in the
growing twilight. All hands on board the Elba were
glad of rest after thirty-six hours of incessant toil.</p>

<p>In the morning, as we had run out the whole of our
cable proper, a piece of the Malta cable was spliced on,
with some smaller coils also on board. Meanwhile, the
Ichnusa had gone ahead at daybreak to take soundings,
and when all was ready we began paying out the cable,
being then, as already stated, about twelve miles from the
land. All went on smoothly, and there was scarcely any
loss of cable by slack. The eye turned naturally, again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
and again, from anxiously counting the lessening coils in
the hold to measure our decreasing distance from the
shore, as its hold features and indentations became hourly
more distinct. Cape Teulada stood right ahead, a bold
headland, with peaked summits 900 feet high. It forms
the eastern point of the Gulf of Palmas, and has a long face
of precipitous cliffs towards the sea. To the west of this
deep inlet appeared the rocky islands of San Antioco and
San Pietro, with cliffs of volcanic formation; and the Toro
rock stood out a bold insulated object, 500 or 600 feet
high, marking the entrance of the Gulf of Palmas, a spacious
bay offering excellent anchorage.</p>

<p>We had run ten miles towards a beach under the cliffs, a
little to the eastward of Cape Teulada, when the small cable,
now in course of being paid out, suddenly parted. The
mishap occurred about a mile and a half from the shore,
in forty fathoms water, with a sandy bottom. It was
provoking enough to have our expectations baulked, when
holding on for another half hour we should have succeeded
in bringing the cable to land; but, for our comfort, the
main difficulties of the enterprise were overcome. The
African cable had been securely laid in the greatest depths
of the Mediterranean, and the shore-end of the line could
be easily recovered in the shallow water. The only question
was, whether it should be immediately effected; but for
this the weather had become very unfavourable. The wind
had been blowing strong from the south-east all the morning;
and a gust of it caught the Elba's stern, and canted it
suddenly round, when the small cable snapped like a packthread.
Rather a heavy sea was now running, and, on the
whole, it was thought advisable to defer the concluding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
operations until an entirely new end to the cable could be
procured from England.</p>

<p>For this purpose, and at the same time to bring out the
Malta cable, the Elba was despatched homeward a few
hours after the accident happened. Fresh angles having
been carefully secured, nothing remained but to take leave
of our friends before the squadron parted,&mdash;the Brandon
for the Levant, and the Sardinian frigates for ports in the
island. While all belonging to the Elba considered that
the submersion of a cable between Algeria and the coast of
Sardinia was virtually a <i>fait accompli</i>, it was almost painful
to witness the dismay of the Italians, at the mishap which
had occurred to cloud their anticipations. It was evident
that they entirely distrusted all assurances of the contractors'
ability to recover the end of the cable, and perfect
the line. Their fears were groundless; within a few weeks
the new coil was brought from England, and the end of
the submerged cable having been grappled at the first
haul, the work was completed without any difficulty.
Messrs. Newall and Liddell immediately proceeded to lay
down the Cagliari and Malta, and the Malta and Corfu
cable, 375 and 420 miles respectively; both which they
effected with entire success in the months of November
and December following, with a very small average waste
of cable over the distance, and in depths equally great
with those in which the African line was laid.</p>

<p>My own object now being to reach Cagliari, the commander
of the Monzambano was kind enough to give
me a passage in his fine frigate. I got on board just as
the officers and their guests were sitting down to dinner
under an awning on the deck. Among them was the old
General Della Marmora, whose love of science and devotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
to the interests of Sardinia had induced him, though suffering
from bad health, to make the voyage for the purpose
of witnessing the important experiment. I found
that he did not share in the apprehensions of the Italian
shareholders on board as to the loss of the cable. The
General had long cherished the idea that the ports of Sardinia,
and especially Cagliari, are destined to partake
largely of the commercial advantages resulting from a
variety of recent events. In a little work, already referred
to, which he was kind enough to give me<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>, he points
out the fine position of Cagliari, its spacious gulf, with
good anchorage, open to the south, and in the highway
of all ships navigating the Mediterranean between the
Straits of Gibraltar, the Levant, and the Black Sea. A
glance at the map, he truly observes, will show no other
port, either on the coast of northern Africa, in Sicily, or the
south of Italy, which can be its rival. Malta alone competes
with it both in position and as a harbour; but he
justly asks,&mdash;&ldquo;Can a barren rock like Malta be compared,
in a commercial point of view, with an island of such
extent, and possessing so many natural resources, as
Sardinia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The General also points out the advantages offered by
the electric telegraph station at Cagliari to masters of
ships bound to the Mediterranean, the Levant, and the
Black Sea, from the ports of Northern Europe, or, <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>, to those coming from the eastward, to induce them
to touch at Cagliari. After, perhaps, long and wearisome
voyages, they will find, he observes, in their very track, in
the heart of the Mediterranean, the means of correspondence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
in a few hours, with their families and their owners,
receiving news and instructions from home. These facilities
he considers of inestimable value; and it strikes
us that the area included in the General's observations
will be much extended when the electric wires are carried
across the Atlantic, and that American ships are more
likely to avail themselves of the advantages offered than
those of any other nation.</p>

<p>Without sharing the sanguine anticipations of the excellent
General La Marmora as to the speedy regeneration of
Sardinia, and the development of her natural resources,
undoubtedly great as they are, the remark may be allowed,
that it would be a singular and happy event if this island,
which appears to have been one of the first, if not the
first, station of the earliest maritime people, in their
advance towards Western Europe, should, now that the
tide of civilisation, so long flowing from the East, has
evidently taken a reflex course, become again that centre
of commercial intercourse for which its geographical position
so well fits it.</p>

<p>Towards evening, the Monzambano was running along
the iron-bound coast terminating with Cape Spartivento,
the western headland of the Gulf of Cagliari. I know not
whether it was from the position of the ruins, or the hazy
state of the atmosphere, night coming on, that I failed to
make out some Cyclopean vestiges mentioned by Captain
Smyth&mdash;Mr. Tyndale says they are a large Nuraghe&mdash;as
standing on one of the most remarkable summits, at an
elevation of upwards of 1000 feet, and called by the peasants,
&ldquo;The Giants' Tower.&rdquo; &ldquo;This structure,&rdquo; observes Captain
Smyth, &ldquo;situated amongst bare cliffs, wild ravines, and
desolate grounds, appeared a ruin of art amidst a ruin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
nature, and imparted to the scene inexpressible grandeur.&rdquo;
During our passage we had a stormy sky and a strong
head-wind, the sun setting gorgeously among masses of
purple and orange clouds. There was nothing to relieve
the barren aspect of this desert coast but the grey watch-towers
from point to point, similar to those we saw on the
coasts of Corsica; and, having paced for an hour the
frigate's long flush deck, I was glad to turn-in early, and
enjoy the comforts of a state cabin after the fatigues and
watches of the two preceding days and nights.</p>

<p>The contrary wind retarded our progress, and it was
not till after daylight that, approaching the harbour of
Cagliari, I enjoyed the fine view, described in a former
chapter, of the city, stretching a long line of suburbs at
the base of the heights crowned by the Casteddu, with its
towers and domes. The frigate entering the port was
moored alongside the government wharf; from which may
be inferred the depth of water, and the class of vessels the
port is capable of receiving. It now contained only about
twenty ships, one only of which, a brig, was under the
English flag. The rest were of small burthen, and mostly
Genoese and French. General La Marmora states, in the
Memoir before quoted, that &ldquo;since the crosses of Savoy
and of Genoa have been united in the same flag,&rdquo; the
Genoese have turned much attention to the trade of Sardinia;
and that a company was forming for the improvement
of the port of Cagliari, in order to draw to it some
part of the corn trade of the Black Sea. Thus the ancient
granary of Rome might become the emporium of the trade
in corn for Italy and Southern France, and even for
Africa; the General observing, with what reason there
may be some doubt, that, while only two voyages can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
made between the ports of those countries and the Black
Sea, three, or even four such, could be accomplished from
Cagliari.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that I did not obtain the latest statistics
of the commerce of Sardinia, and the port of Cagliari
in particular, from our very intelligent Consul, Mr. Craig;
recollecting only his having mentioned that coal is the
principal import from England;&mdash;France and Genoa, I
conclude, supplying manufactured articles and colonial
produce. Salt, he said, was the chief export, great part of
it being shipped to Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>

<p>I cannot mention Mr. Craig, for the last time in these
pages, without an acknowledgment of the many kind
offices for which I am indebted to him during the present
and preceding visits to Sardinia, nor can I easily forget
the pleasure enjoyed in his amiable family circle. Hours
so spent in a foreign country have a double charm; for in
such agreeable society the traveller breathes the atmosphere,
and is restored to the habits, of his cherished home.
I have no reason to think that Mr. Craig's long and
valuable services are not duly appreciated by his Government;
but it might be wished that, in any re-arrangement
of the consular service, they be taken into consideration.
It is a sort of honourable exile for a man to spend sixteen
years of his life on a foreign service, with a family growing
up, who enjoy very rare opportunities of conversing with
any of their own countrymen, and still less of their countrywomen,
in their mother tongue. I take some liberty
in venturing to offer these wholly unauthorized remarks on
a subject of some delicacy; and only wish I could flatter
myself they have any chance of reaching influential quarters,
and not being forgotten. Mr. Craig's position, respected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
and esteemed as he long has been, is eligible in
many respects; but it might perhaps be improved.</p>

<p>At the Consul-General's I again met some of the officers
of the Ichnusa, to whom, as well as to Boyl commanding
the Monzambano, I wish to offer my acknowledgments
for many civilities. Lieutenant Baudini, of the Ichnusa
and other Sardinian officers who understand English,
may chance to peruse this page, and will interpret my
sentiments to their brother officers. Commandant Boyl
was kind enough to give me a passage to Genoa, being
under orders for that port. We had a pleasant run, the
style of living on board the Monzambano being excellent,
the society agreeable, and enjoying magnificent
weather. I have before observed that the officers of the
Sardinian navy are intelligent and gentlemanly, and appear
to be well up to their profession. The crews are smart,
and every thing aboard the ship was in the highest order
and conducted with perfect discipline.</p>

<p>Steaming close in-shore along the eastern coast of Sardinia,
remarkable principally for its bold and sterile
character, there was a striking contrast in the appearance
of the same coast of Corsica, which came in sight after
crossing the mouth of the Straits of Bonifacio. This was
comparatively verdant, not only as regards the fertile
plains of the <i>littorale</i>, described in an early chapter, but,
even where the mountain ranges approached the Mediterranean
south of these extensive plains, the sterile aspect of
their towering summits and precipitous cliffs was often
relieved by immense forests encircling their bases, while
every hillside and slope to the valleys appeared densely
clothed with the evergreen <i>macchia</i>, for which Corsica is so
remarkable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>Part of this coast was already well known to the homeward
bound traveller: again he caught sight of the bold
outlines of Elba and Monte Cristo, rising out of the Tuscan
sea; again, as on the first evening of these rambles, the
white terraces of Bastia reflected the rays of the setting
sun. Soon afterwards the mountain ranges of Capo-Corso
were veiled in darkness, and, as we ran along the shore
nothing was visible but the twinkling lights of the fishermen's
huts in the little <i>marinas</i>, to bring to mind those
features which had so fascinated us on our first approach
to the island.</p>

<p>Again, farewell to Corsica! Farewell to the twin islands
which, like emeralds set in an enamelled vase, deck the
centre of the great Mediterranean bason, embraced by the
coasts of Italy, France, and Spain,&mdash;radiant points midway
to Africa, in the great highway to the East, and partaking
the varied character of all these climes. It had been my
fortune not only to ramble through these islands from
north to south, but, in different voyages, to sail round the
entire coasts of both, except some part of the west of Sardinia.
I can only wish that these pages more adequately
represented the impressions made under the opportunities
thus enjoyed.</p>

<p>It was again my fortune to approach the lovely bay of
Genoa with the earliest morning light; and, taking leave
of my good friends on board the Monzambano, I landed
before breakfast. To vary the route homeward, instead
of crossing the Mont-Cenis, as had been done in frost
and snow at a late season of the year in the former tour,
I enjoyed the enviable contrast of journeying along the
<i>Riviera di Ponente</i> from Genoa to Nice,&mdash;that exquisite
strip of country between the Apennines and the Mediterranean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
studded with orchards, orange groves, vineyards,
and gardens; with towns, towers, churches, and
convents, nestled in the groves, washed by the sea, or
perched high on rocky pinnacles; and all this encircling
the lovely Bay of Genoa, the road being carried <i>en corniche</i>
along its winding shores and round its jutting points. Of
this exquisite scenery no description of mine could convey
any adequate idea to those who have not seen it, and those
who have will need little memento to bring its varied
features to their recollection.</p>

<p>Farewell, a long farewell to, perhaps, the loveliest
strip of country in the bright South! The Neapolitan
proverb may be applied with equal justice to the Ligurian,
as to the fair Campanian, coast,&mdash;<i>vedere e p&oacute;i morire</i>,&mdash;a
fitting motto wherewith to conclude the tale of an old
man's wanderings.</p>

<p>Pursuing the journey from Nice to Marseilles, in heat
and in dust, the express train, by Lyons and Paris, conveyed
the Rambler to Calais in about thirty hours, and six
more landed him in London.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> &ldquo;With all the outrages,&rdquo; continues Mr. Benson, &ldquo;of which Galluchio
and his followers are guilty, he is by no means void of moral feeling, and
is quite a polished character when he enters private society, as I learnt
from a French gentleman who had met him at breakfast at the house of a
mutual acquaintance. My friend, when he found himself in such company,
naturally betrayed a little alarm, but Galluchio reassured him, saying,
&#8216;You and yours have nothing to fear at my hands.&#8217;
</p><p>
&ldquo;I am really afraid to extract from my notes many of the wild adventures
of this Corsican Rob Roy. Not long since, a shepherd, personating
him, violated a female peasant. The chieftain soon obtained information
of the gross outrage that had been committed on his character; and finding
the shepherd, took him before the mayor of Bagniola, and this at a
time when Galluchio had six sentences of death hanging over him. At the
chieftain's instigation, the shepherd was compelled to espouse the poor
girl. Galluchio, after the marriage had been solemnised, said to the
shepherd, &#8216;Remember that you make a good husband. I shall keep a
watchful eye over your conduct; and should I hear that your wife receives
any maltreatment from you, yourself and your family shall pay with their
lives for your misconduct.&#8217; The man little attended to Galluchio's warning.
The chieftain adhered to his threat, and the shepherd, with his
father and several other members of the same family, fell victims.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Benson's

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Ridiculously trifling as the origin of this bloody quarrel may appear,
the story is very probably founded on fact. Renucci relates another
scarcely less absurd. Feuds, similar to those mentioned in the play, had
long existed between the Vinconti and Grimaldi families, inhabitants of
the village of Monte d'Olmo, in the <i>pieve</i> of Ampugnano. Like good
Catholics, however, they met sometimes at mass. The church was sacred
and neutral ground; there, at least, the <i>tr&ecirc;ve de Dieu</i> might be supposed
to be in force. Thither, on some solemn feast, the villagers, indiscriminately,
bent their steps. Some had already entered the church, and were
engaged in their devotions, many loitered about the door, and the <i>piazza</i>
was crowded. Talking about one thing and another, the conversation
naturally turned to the ceremonies of the day, and a dispute arose whether
the officiating clergy ought to wear the black hoods of the Confraternity
in the processions which formed part of the service.
</p><p>
Orso Paolo, one of the Vincenti family, gave it as his opinion that they
should wear their surplices, alleging that to be the ancient and fitting
custom.
</p><p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Ruggero Grimaldi, &ldquo;they ought to wear the black
hoods;&rdquo; giving reasons equally authoritative for his view of the question.
</p><p>
The strife waxed warm. The villagers took one side or the other;
&ldquo;hoods,&rdquo; and &ldquo;surplices,&rdquo; became the party cries. From words they
came to blows, and Orso Paolo, the only man of the Vincenti family present,
being sore pressed in the struggle, rashly drew out a pistol, and
mortally wounded Ruggero Grimaldi's eldest son.
</p><p>
So the story begins, and as it is one of the few in Renucci's &ldquo;<i>Novelle</i>&rdquo;
that are worth translating, we will give the sequel.
</p><p>
The rage and fury of Grimaldi and his party were now worked up to
the highest pitch. The mass was interrupted, the church deserted, and
the whole village a scene of uproar. Orso Paolo fled as soon as he had
fired the fatal shot, pursued by his enemies, who overtook and surrounded
him. His fate had been sealed on the spot, but that, quick as lightning,
he burst through the throng and darted into a house of which the door
stood open. It was the house of Grimaldi, his deadly foe, but there was
no other chance of escaping instant death. To close and bar the door,
and stand on his defence, was the work of a moment. Corsican houses
are strongholds; Orso Paolo was in possession of the enemy's fortress.
He threatens death to the first assailant, and the boldest recoil. What
was to be done? It was proposed to set fire to the house, but Ruggero's
youngest son, a child of seven or eight years old, had been left asleep in
the house when the family went to church. He would perish in the
flames. At that thought Grimaldi became irresolute. Just at this moment
the eldest son is brought from the church, bleeding to death from his
mortal wound, amidst lamentations and women's shrieks. At that spectacle
Ruggero can no longer contain himself. Frantic with grief, he runs
to set fire to his own house. The voice of nature pleading for his remaining
child is stifled by passion and resentment. The tears and expostulations
of the wretched mother are of no avail; they have no influence over
the mind of the infuriated father.
</p><p>
&ldquo;What are you doing, cruel Ruggero?&rdquo; she cried, in the midst of sobs
and groans; &ldquo;Is it for you to fill up our cup of misery? Will you destroy
the dearest and sweetest of our hopes? One son is gasping his last breath
before our eyes, the other, still in infancy, will perish from the transports
of your rage. Who, then, will be the support of our miserable old age?
Who will defend us from the insults of the powerful?&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;So that Orso Paolo perish, let the world be at an end!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ruggero. Such is the terrible force of the passions in the human breast.
</p><p>
Ruggero's house is burning, the fire crackles, the flames burst forth,
the sparkles fill the air. Vincenti, involved in smoke and flame, rushes
from place to place, seeking a retreat to prolong his life for a few moments.
All at once he is startled by the wailing cries of a child. He directs his
steps towards it, and discovers, with amazement, the son of his cruel
enemy. Struck with indignation at the father's barbarity, he suddenly
raises his hand to take vengeance on the child of his relentless adversary.
The boy utters a plaintive cry, and stretches its little hands towards him,
trembling and frightened.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Take courage, my boy, take courage!&rdquo; said Vincenti, snatching him
to his bosom; &ldquo;you see a man who is not deaf to the voice of pity. If
Heaven will not protect your innocency, at least you shall die in the arms
of a second father.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Meanwhile, the fire spreads through every part of the building; nothing
can resist the fury of the devouring flames. Fanned by the wind, they
surge in waves, ever greedy of new food. The roof quivers, the floors
crack, the whole falls with a terrible crash. What chance was there for
Vincenti's escape with life? He had abandoned all hopes.
</p><p>
Ruggero, satiated with vengeance, retires to the house of a relation, to
which his wounded son had been removed. The spectacle of his sufferings,
his imminent danger, and the sobs and lamentations of his inconsolable
wife, awaken in his soul the affections of a father. A faint ray of reason
penetrates his mind, and he perceives all the horrors of his proceeding.
Trouble, remorse, repentance, succeed; his heart is wrung with anguish,
and he attempts his own life. Friends interfere to restrain him.
</p><p>
At the news of the atrocity committed by the Grimaldi, in firing the
house and leaving their enemy to perish in the ruins, the kinsmen of
Orso Paolo assemble and rush to Monte d'Olmo, threatening vengeance
on the perpetrators. The Grimaldi rally round Ruggero to shield him
from his exasperated enemies. Just then, shouts are raised in the piazza,
mingled with the name of Vincenti, and at intervals with gentler sounds
which speak to the heart of the wife of Ruggero.
</p><p>
She flies to the window, and exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh heaven! Orso Paolo!
My son! My son! My son!&rdquo; falls speechless and fainting on the floor.
The spectacle which produced this vivid emotion was that of the noble
Vincenti, who, scorched, and covered with ashes, and pressing the child
firmly to his breast, was hastening on amid the acclamations and <i>evvivas</i> of
the populace. He had taken refuge under an arch of the staircase, clasping
the child firmly in his arms.
</p><p>
Ruggero's wife, recovering from her swoon, runs and throws herself
into the arms of Vincenti, calling him the preserver and father of her
beloved son. Ruggero, full of admiration and gratitude, salutes Vincenti,
with a modest humility, invoking his pardon, and begging his friendship.
Vincenti embraces him, pardons him, and swears eternal friendship for
him. The wounded youth unexpectedly recovers, the two factions become
friends, and the generous Vincenti, loaded with praises and benedictions,
had the happiness to extinguish an inveterate feud between the two families,
and thus restore peace to the community of Castel d'Acqua.</p></div>

little squadron then employed in the service of assisting in the laying down
the submarine telegraph cable between Cape Teulada and the coast of
Algeria, of which I hope to be able to give some account in the sequel.
The engineer of the &ldquo;Ichneusa&rdquo; was an Englishman, who was often ashore
at our hotel while his ship lay in the harbour of La Madelena; an intelligent
man, as I have always found the many of his class employed in the
royal steam navy of the Sardinian government. I cannot believe that the
engineers of the steam-ship &ldquo;Cagliari&rdquo; had any complicity with the Genoese
conspirators. They worked the ship, no doubt, in compliance with orders
enforced by the Italian desperadoes in possession of her with stilettoes at
their throats; and it is to be regretted that peremptory measures were not
taken by our Government for their release. We can only conclude that
the unfortunate engineers were sacrificed to political expediency.</p></div>

of Sardinia, may be gathered from the remarks and sarcasms of a host of
early authors. Martial, in mentioning the hour of death, celebrates salubrious
Tibur at the expense of this pestilent isle:

&ldquo;Cicero, who hated Tigellius, the flattering musical buffoon so well
described by Horace, thus lashes his country in a letter to Fabius Gallus:
&#8216;Id ego in lucris pono non ferre hominem pestilentiorem putri&acirc; su&acirc;.&#8217;
Again, writing to his brother: &#8216;Remember,&#8217; says he, &#8216;though in perfect
health, you are in Sardinia.&#8217; And Pausanias, Cornelius Nepos, Strabo,
Tacitus, Silius Italicus, and Claudian, severally bear testimony to the
current opinion. In later times the terse Dante sings:

salt and tobacco, a royal monopoly, leased for terms of years at a considerable
rent. Upwards of 9000 cantars (about 375 tons) are brought
down every year from the mountains of Fundada Cungiata and Genargentu,
and carried on horseback to all parts of the island. The labour,
fatigue, and difficulty attending the conveyance of the snow from those
great altitudes are severe; as in the paths where there is no footing for
a horse, the men are obliged to carry the burden on their shoulders;
and the quantity they can bear is a matter of boast and rivalry among
them.
</p><p>
It has been observed in a former chapter that none of the Sardinian
mountains rise to what would be the level of perpetual frost. The snow
trade must therefore be supplied from deep hollows in the mountains,
serving as natural ice-houses, in which it is lodged during the summer.
</p><p>
We have an account of a forest in Scotland held of the Crown
by the tenure of the delivery of a snow-ball on any day of the year on
which it may be demanded; and it is said that there is no danger of
forfeiture for default of the quit-rent, the chasms of Benewish holding
snow, in the form of a glacier, throughout the year.&mdash;<i>Pennant's Tour in

been supposed to refer to the Nuraghe. The words are these:&mdash;&ldquo;It is
said that in the island of Sardinia are edifices of the ancients, erected after
the Greek manner, and many other beautiful buildings and <i>tholi</i> (domes
or cupolas) finished in excellent proportions.&rdquo; Again, Diodorus Siculus
informs us (l. iv. c. 29, 30) that &ldquo;after Iolaus had settled his colony in
Sardinia, he sent for D&aelig;dalus out of Sicily and employed him in building
many and great works which remain to this day.&rdquo; And in another place
(l. v. c. 51) he reckons among these works &ldquo;temples of the gods,&rdquo; of
which, he repeats, &ldquo;the remains exist even in these times.&rdquo; These passages,
however, afford but slight grounds for considering that the Nuraghe
were built by the Greeks, or even were temples of the gods. The term
&#920;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#973;&#962;, used by Aristotle, may indeed describe a round building roofed with
a dome, but the Nuraghe cannot be considered as corresponding to the
Grecian idea of buildings that are &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;finished in excellent
proportions&rdquo;&mdash;or fitting temples for the gods. Pausanias denies that
D&aelig;dalus was sent for out of Sicily by Iolaus, and makes it an anachronism.

their possessions. Moses relates that &ldquo;the Emims dwelt therein [that is,
